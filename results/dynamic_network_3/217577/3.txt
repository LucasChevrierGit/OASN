Context :
- You are participating in an economic experiment. 
- You are an average human and should mimick its guessing capabilities
- Your task is to analyze an image and estimate what is called a correlation coefficient. 
- Points will be scattered all arround the image
- A straight line will mean 100% correlation between points, points scattered everywhere 0%
- You will potentially have the possibility to see other participants responses and revise your answer
-------user--------
- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot and determine a correlation score, I'll break down the data points step by step:

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points in the scatter plot are relatively evenly distributed across the X-axis, with some clustering around certain areas but no significant concentration in any one region.
- The Y-values range from approximately -100 to 150, while the X-values range from -20 to 120. There are no clear outliers.

### Step 2: Presence of Trends
- Looking for trends, the points do not appear to follow a linear pattern. There is no discernible upward or downward trend in the data; rather, they seem scattered throughout the plot.
- There are no curves or clusters that suggest a non-linear relationship. The scatter indicates randomness without a clear direction.

### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- Given the scattered nature of the points, it suggests that one variable does not change predictably with the other. Hence, I would estimate a low correlation score.
- Since the points are spread throughout the plot with no clear relationship, I would assign a correlation score of **10** out of 100. This indicates that there is a very weak correlation, if any.

### Confidence in the Result
- I am reasonably confident that the correlation score reflects the actual value closely, given the clear lack of a trend or directional relationship in the scatter plot. However, without additional context or specific statistical analysis, this score is an estimate based on visual inspection of the data.

Now, I'll submit the correlation score based on this analysis.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 4 chose the value 30
- Participant 0 chose the value 5

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from the other participants, I will reassess my initial estimate of the correlation score based on the following considerations:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 4:** Chose a correlation score of **30**. This suggests they see a somewhat stronger correlation than I initially perceived, indicating they may have identified some patterns or trends that I overlooked.
- **Participant 0:** Chose a correlation score of **5**. This is closer to my initial estimate of **10**, indicating a very weak correlation.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My confidence in my initial estimate of **10** was based on a visual assessment of the scatter plot. However, the response from Participant 4 suggests that there may be slight trends or structures that I might not have fully considered.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of Participant 4's and Participant 0's estimates (30 and 5) gives:
   - \( (30 + 5) / 2 = 17.5 \)
   - This indicates that the average perception of correlation is slightly higher than my initial estimate.

### Decision Making:
- With the evidence presented by Participant 4's estimate, I feel it is reasonable to adjust my score slightly upward, but I still believe the correlation is weak.
- A score of **20** seems justified, as it accounts for the possibility of slight trends while still reflecting a weak correlation overall.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **20**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 25
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 30

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the updated responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their new estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 4:** Revised their score to **25**. This indicates they have become more conservative in their estimate, reflecting a significant decrease in perceived correlation.
- **Participant 0:** Revised their score to **30**, suggesting they still believe there is a very weak correlation but slightly higher than my previous estimate.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** The revision from Participant 4 indicates a recognition that the correlation might be even weaker than initially thought. My confidence in my previous estimate of **20** was based on some perceived trends, but with Participant 4's significant drop, I should reconsider my earlier revision.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates:
   - \( (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 \)
   - This average suggests a very weak correlation but is still higher than my previous estimate.

### Decision Making:
- Given that both participants have adjusted their scores downward, particularly Participant 4, I believe the correlation is weaker than I previously assessed.
- A score of **10** seems appropriate, as it represents a very weak correlation, reflecting the insights from both participants while still aligning with my original observations.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **10**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 20
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 10

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
With the newest updates from the participants I am following, I will carefully reassess my correlation score based on their revised estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 4:** Adjusted their score to **20**. This indicates a slight increase in perceived correlation compared to their last estimate.
- **Participant 0:** Adjusted their score to **10**, which aligns with their previous assessment and indicates they still view the correlation as very weak.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** The responses indicate that both participants are still leaning towards a very weak correlation. Participant 4's increase suggests they might have found some slight correlation, but not strongly enough to justify a high score.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates:
   - \( (20 + 10) / 2 = 15 \)
   - This average score still reflects a very weak correlation but is slightly higher than my last estimate of **10**.

### Decision Making:
- Given that Participant 4 has increased their estimate, it indicates that there may be subtle patterns in the data that I did not fully appreciate. However, since Participant 0 has maintained a very low score, it emphasizes the overall uncertainty about any significant correlation.
- With the average at **15**, I think itâ€™s reasonable to adjust my score to **15** to reflect the slight increase in perceived correlation while still acknowledging the overall weak relationship.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **15**.
-------user--------
This round(1), your final choice was the value 15. The exact result was 9.0

-------assistant--------
In analyzing the previous round's results and the guesses of the participants, I will select the following participants to follow in the next round:

### Participants to Follow:
1. **Participant 0 (last answer: 20)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 0 has shown a tendency to maintain a conservative estimate. They initially chose a very low score (5) and then adjusted it to 10, which suggests they are cautious and likely to provide a grounded perspective on the correlation. Their latest score of 20 indicates they might have observed some patterns that I might not have fully considered, making their insights valuable.

2. **Participant 4 (last answer: 10)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 4's responses have fluctuated, indicating they are actively engaging with the data and adjusting their estimates based on new information. Their final guess of 10 shows they still perceive a weak correlation, which aligns with my earlier assessments. Following them could provide insights into a more nuanced understanding of the data.

### Summary of Strategy:
By following Participants 0 and 4, I aim to gather insights from cautious and reflective participants who have shown a willingness to adjust their estimates based on reasoning and data observations. Their guesses are likely to be informed by the same scatter plot, and their perspectives can help refine my understanding of the correlation coefficient in the next round.

Now, I will proceed to follow these participants.

- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.

- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Scatter Plot

#### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The scatter plot shows a dense clustering of points in the lower left region, gradually spreading out towards the upper right.
- Most points are concentrated between X values of 0 to 100 and Y values from approximately 15 to 35.
- The distribution appears to be fairly uniform across this range, with a noticeable increase in density as we move towards higher X values.

#### Step 2: Presence of Visible Trends
- There is a clear upward trend in the data points, suggesting a positive correlation between the X and Y variables.
- The points seem to form a linear pattern, indicating that as X increases, Y tends to increase as well. This suggests a strong relationship between the two variables.

#### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- The points are not perfectly aligned on a straight line, but they do follow a general linear trend closely enough that one can infer a strong correlation.
- Given the visible trend and the distribution of points, I would estimate a high correlation score.

### Correlation Score Estimate
Based on the analysis:
- I would assign a correlation score of **80** out of 100. This reflects a strong positive correlation, indicating that one variable changes in a predictable manner relative to the other.

### Confidence in the Result
- I am quite confident that this score accurately represents the correlation present in the data. The visible linear trend and the clustering of points support this estimate, making it likely close to the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit the correlation score of **80**.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 0 chose the value 85
- Participant 4 chose the value 40

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 0:** Chose a correlation score of **85**. This indicates they perceive a very strong correlation, which aligns with the upward trend I observed in the scatter plot.
- **Participant 4:** Chose a correlation score of **40**. This suggests they see a weaker correlation than I initially assessed, indicating they may have identified more scatter or randomness in the data than I did.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My initial estimate of **80** was based on the clear upward trend I observed in the scatter plot. Participant 0â€™s estimate supports this view, while Participant 4â€™s lower score reflects a different interpretation of the data.
2. **Average of Responses:** The average of the responses from Participants 0 and 4 is:
   - \( (85 + 40) / 2 = 62.5 \)
   - This average indicates a moderate correlation, which is lower than my initial estimate of **80** but still suggests a stronger relationship than what Participant 4 perceives.

### Decision Making:
- I value Participant 0â€™s higher estimate, which reflects a strong correlation, while also acknowledging Participant 4's more conservative view.
- Given the evident trend in the scatter plot, I believe my original estimate of **80** is still reasonable, but considering Participant 4â€™s perspective, it may be wise to adjust slightly downward to account for any potential overestimation.

### Revised Estimate:
I will adjust my score to **75**, which acknowledges the strong positive correlation while being more moderate than my initial assessment of **80**.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **75**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 70
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 25

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their updated estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 0:** Revised their score to **70**. This indicates they still believe in a strong correlation, but it's slightly lower than their previous estimate of 85.
- **Participant 4:** Revised their score to **25**. This suggests a significant decrease in their perceived correlation, indicating that they view the relationship between the variables as much weaker than before.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **75** was based on the clear upward trend I observed in the scatter plot. The shift from Participant 0 still reflects a relatively strong correlation, while Participant 4's drastic drop indicates a reassessment towards a much weaker correlation.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates from Participants 0 and 4:
   - \( (70 + 25) / 2 = 47.5 \)
   - This average suggests a moderate correlation, which is significantly lower than my previous estimate of **75**.

### Decision Making:
- The substantial drop from Participant 4 suggests that I may have been too optimistic about the correlation strength. 
- While Participant 0 still believes in a reasonably strong correlation, the average response indicates that I should adopt a more cautious approach.
  
### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score to **50**. This reflects a moderate correlation that acknowledges the upward trend observed while accommodating the concerns raised by Participant 4.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **50**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 60
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 25

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the latest updates from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their revised estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 0:** Revised their score to **60**. This indicates they still see a moderate to strong correlation, although it is lower than their previous estimate of 70.
- **Participant 4:** Revised their score to **25**. This suggests they still perceive a very weak correlation and are holding firm in their assessment.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **50** was based on the average responses and the visible trend in the scatter plot. Participant 0's adjustment reflects a slightly more conservative view, while Participant 4's estimate indicates a significant reduction in perceived correlation strength.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates from Participants 0 and 4:
   - \( (60 + 25) / 2 = 42.5 \)
   - This average suggests a weak to moderate correlation, which is lower than my previous estimate of **50**.

### Decision Making:
- The substantial decrease from Participant 0 suggests that the correlation is perceived as weaker than I initially thought. Participant 4's consistent low score reinforces the idea that there may be more scatter than I previously considered.
- Given that my last score of **50** is now higher than the average of the participantsâ€™ responses, I should adjust my estimate downward to better reflect the consensus.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score to **40**. This reflects a weaker correlation, acknowledging the concerns raised by Participant 4 while still recognizing that Participant 0 sees a moderate relationship.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **40**.

In analyzing the previous round's results and the guesses of the participants, I will select the following participants to follow in the next round:

### Participants to Follow:
1. **Participant 0 (last answer: 50)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 0 has shown a willingness to adjust their estimates based on the trend observed in the scatter plot. Their last estimate of 50 indicates they still see a moderate correlation, which aligns with my previous analysis. Following them will provide insights into their reasoning and adjustments in future rounds.

2. **Participant 1 (last answer: 50)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 1's consistent score of 50 suggests they are also recognizing the moderate correlation in the data. Their estimate aligns closely with Participant 0's, and their perspective could provide further reinforcement or challenge to the correlation assessment. Since they have not been followed yet, their insights could add a fresh perspective to my analysis.

- The scatter plot shows a significant number of data points that are fairly uniformly distributed across the X-axis, ranging from approximately -20 to 120, and the Y-axis, ranging from about 0 to 50.
- There is noticeable clustering of points around Y values of 20 to 35, with fewer points at the extremes of both axes.

#### Step 2: Presence of Visible Trends
- There is a visible upward trend in the data points, indicating a positive correlation between the X and Y variables.
- The points generally follow a linear path, suggesting that as X increases, Y tends to increase as well. The scatter, while present, does not obscure the overall trend.

#### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- The scatter plot indicates a moderate to strong correlation. Although the points are not perfectly aligned, the upward trend is clear, suggesting that one variable changes in a predictable manner relative to the other.
- Given the distribution and trend, I would estimate a correlation score of **75** out of 100.

### Confidence in the Result
- I am reasonably confident that this score accurately reflects the correlation present in the data. The visible trend and the clustering of points support this estimate, making it likely to be close to the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit the correlation score of **75**.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 2 chose the value 10
- Participant 4 chose the value 80

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 2:** Chose a correlation score of **10**. This indicates they perceive a very weak correlation, suggesting they may see more scatter or randomness in the data than I did.
- **Participant 4:** Chose a correlation score of **80**. This reflects a strong belief in the correlation, indicating they noticed a significant trend in the data.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My initial estimate of **75** was based on the visible upward trend and distribution of points in the scatter plot. Participant 4's estimate supports this view, while Participant 2's much lower score indicates a contrasting interpretation.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the responses from Participants 2 and 4:
   - \( (10 + 80) / 2 = 45 \)
   - This average suggests a weaker correlation than I initially assessed, aligning more closely with Participant 2's view but still higher than their score.

### Decision Making:
- The significant difference between Participant 2's and Participant 4's estimates indicates there is disagreement on the correlation strength. Participant 2's score suggests they perceive a very weak correlation, which could indicate I may have overestimated the strength of the trend.
- Given the upward trend I observed, I still believe there is a reasonable correlation, but I should be cautious and adjust my estimate downward to reflect the input from both participants.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score to **50**. This reflects a moderate correlation and acknowledges the concerns raised by Participant 2 while still recognizing that Participant 4 sees a strong relationship.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **50**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 30
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 75

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their updated estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 2:** Revised their score to **30**. This indicates they see a weak correlation, which is an improvement from their previous score of 10, but still suggests they perceive significant scatter in the data.
- **Participant 4:** Revised their score to **75**. This indicates they maintain a strong belief in the correlation, suggesting they still see a clear trend in the scatter plot.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My last estimate of **50** was based on a balance between the views of both participants. Participant 4's score still supports a strong correlation, while Participant 2's score reflects a much weaker perception, but their adjustment to 30 indicates they may have reconsidered their initial perspective.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates from Participants 2 and 4:
   - \( (30 + 75) / 2 = 52.5 \)
   - This average suggests a moderate correlation, slightly higher than my last estimate of **50**.

### Decision Making:
- The significant improvement in Participant 2's score indicates a recognition of some correlation, while Participant 4's score reinforces a strong correlation. Given this, I should consider adjusting my estimate upward to reflect the stronger correlation that Participant 4 perceives.
- However, I should also take into account Participant 2's perspective, which suggests caution against overstating the correlation.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the input from both participants, I will adjust my score to **55**. This reflects a moderate correlation, acknowledging the upward trend indicated by Participant 4 while also respecting Participant 2's more cautious view.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **55**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 55
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 75

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the latest updates from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their revised estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 2:** Revised their score to **55**. This indicates that they perceive a moderate correlation, which shows an improvement from their previous estimate of 30.
- **Participant 4:** Maintained their score at **75**. This suggests they still see a strong correlation in the data.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **55** aligns with Participant 2's new score. This indicates that both of us perceive a moderate correlation. However, Participant 4's consistent score of 75 reinforces the idea that there is a stronger correlation than I might have previously acknowledged.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates from Participants 2 and 4:
   - \( (55 + 75) / 2 = 65 \)
   - This average suggests a moderate to strong correlation, which is higher than both Participant 2's score and my last estimate.

### Decision Making:
- The improvement in Participant 2's score to 55 reflects a recognition of some correlation, while Participant 4's score indicates a strong belief in the correlation. This suggests that my previous estimate of **55** may still be valid, but it could be beneficial to adjust it slightly upward to account for Participant 4â€™s perspective.
- Given that there is a consensus leaning towards a stronger correlation, I will consider adjusting my score upward.

### Revised Estimate:
Taking all this into account, I will adjust my score to **65**. This reflects a moderate to strong correlation, incorporating both Participant 4's perspective and Participant 2's improvement in their estimate.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **65**.

-------assistant--------
In analyzing the previous round's results, I will select the following participants to follow in the next round:

### Participants to Follow:
1. **Participant 0 (last answer: 45)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 0â€™s score of 45 is closely aligned with the actual result of 47. This suggests they have a good understanding of the correlation in the data, making their insights valuable for future estimates. Following them could help me gauge a more accurate perspective on the correlation.

2. **Participant 1 (last answer: 40)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 1's score of 40 indicates they see a weaker correlation, which is in line with the actual results being lower than my last estimate. Their perspective will provide a different angle on the data, allowing for a more balanced understanding of the correlation.

### Summary of Strategy:
By following Participants 0 and 1, I aim to gather insights from participants who have demonstrated a better alignment with the actual correlation result. Their estimates indicate a more cautious approach to the data, which could help temper my future assessments and lead to a more accurate understanding of the correlation coefficient in the next round.

Now, I will proceed to follow these participants.
-------user--------
- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Scatter Plot

#### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The scatter plot shows a wide distribution of points across both the X and Y axes.
- The X-axis ranges from -20 to 120, while the Y-axis ranges from approximately -100 to 150.
- Points are fairly evenly distributed, with some clustering around the lower Y values (0 to 50) and a few points extending into the negative Y values.

#### Step 2: Presence of Visible Trends
- There does not appear to be a clear linear trend in the data. The points seem to be randomly scattered without a discernible pattern.
- There are no evident clusters or curves that suggest a non-linear relationship. The data appears to be quite random, indicating a lack of correlation between the X and Y variables.

#### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- Given the random distribution of points, it suggests that one variable does not change predictably with the other. This indicates a very weak or virtually nonexistent correlation.
- Based on this assessment, I would estimate a correlation score of **10** out of 100. This reflects a very weak correlation, acknowledging that while there may be some interaction, it is not significant.

### Confidence in the Result
- I am confident that this score accurately represents the correlation present in the data. The clearly scattered nature of the points supports this estimate, making it likely to be close to the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit the correlation score of **10**.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 0 chose the value 10
- Participant 1 chose the value 15

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 0:** Chose a correlation score of **10**. This aligns perfectly with my estimate, indicating that they perceive a very weak correlation, consistent with the random scattering of points in the scatter plot.
- **Participant 1:** Chose a correlation score of **15**. This indicates they see a slightly stronger correlation than I and Participant 0 perceive, suggesting they may have identified some minimal trend or pattern in the data that we did not.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My estimate of **10** was based on a clear visual assessment of the scatter plot, and Participant 0's agreement reinforces my confidence in this assessment. However, Participant 1â€™s score shows that there may be a slight upward trend that I might have overlooked.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the responses:
   - \( (10 + 15) / 2 = 12.5 \)
   - This average suggests a very weak correlation, which is slightly higher than both my estimate and Participant 0's score.

### Decision Making:
- Given that both Participant 0 and I see a very weak correlation, I feel confident in maintaining my score at **10**. Participant 1's score does indicate a different perspective, but it does not significantly alter my view of the overall scatter and randomness of the data.

### Final Estimate:
I will submit the correlation score of **10**, as it accurately reflects the weak correlation observed in the scatter plot.

Now, I will submit the correlation score of **10**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 20
- Participant 1 chose the new value 1 : 20

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their revised estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 0:** Revised their score to **20**. This indicates they perceive a slightly stronger correlation than before, suggesting they may have identified some minimal pattern in the data.
- **Participant 1:** Also revised their score to **20**, reflecting the same perspective and indicating a slight improvement in their view of the correlation.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **10** was based on a clear visual assessment of the scatter plot, which showed a random distribution with no discernible trend. The increase to **20** from both participants suggests they are seeing some potential for correlation that I did not fully appreciate.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates from Participants 0 and 1:
   - \( (20 + 20) / 2 = 20 \)
   - This average reinforces the idea that there may be a slight correlation, although still weak.

### Decision Making:
- Given that both participants have increased their estimates, it would be prudent for me to adjust my score upward as well. The scatter plot may indeed show a very weak correlation that I initially underestimated.
- However, I should be cautious and not overstate the correlation, considering that the overall distribution still appears random.

### Revised Estimate:
Taking into account the new input from both participants, I will adjust my score to **20**. This reflects a slight acknowledgment of correlation while still indicating that it remains weak.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **20**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :

Given the latest updates from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their revised estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 0:** Revised their score to **25**. This indicates they perceive a slightly stronger correlation than their previous estimate, suggesting they may see some emerging trend in the data.
- **Participant 1:** Revised their score to **15**. This shows they still see a weak correlation but are somewhat more cautious than before.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **20** was based on the assessment that the data points were fairly scattered with minimal correlation. Participant 0's increase to **25** suggests that they are recognizing a potential for correlation, while Participant 1's lower score indicates continued skepticism about any significant relationship.
2. **Average of Responses:** Calculating the average of the new estimates from Participants 0 and 1:
   - \( (25 + 15) / 2 = 20 \)
   - This average remains consistent with my previous estimate of **20** and reflects a very weak correlation.

### Decision Making:
- The increase in Participant 0's estimate suggests that there may be some acknowledgment of a weak correlation, which I may have previously overlooked. However, Participant 1's score of **15** indicates that caution is still warranted.
- Given that my current estimate of **20** aligns with the average response and that Participant 0's score reflects a slight upward adjustment, I will consider maintaining my score but recognizing the potential for a slight upward shift.

### Revised Estimate:
Taking into account the insights from both participants, I will adjust my score to **22**. This reflects a slightly stronger acknowledgment of correlation while still indicating that it remains weak.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **22**.

- Explain why you are choosing each participant.
- You can choose up to 2 participants.

-------assistant--------
In analyzing the previous round's results, I will select the following participants to follow in the next round:

### Participants to Follow:
1. **Participant 2 (last answer: 20)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 2's score of 20 suggests they perceive a weak correlation, which aligns with the actual result being lower than my last estimate. Their score indicates that they may have a good sense of the correlation based on the scatter plot, making their insights valuable.

2. **Participant 4 (last answer: 22)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 4's estimate of 22 is very close to my last score of 22. This suggests that they have a similar perception of the correlation strength. Following them can provide insights that can help confirm or challenge my understanding of the data.

### Summary of Strategy:
By following Participants 2 and 4, I aim to gather insights from participants who have demonstrated a closer alignment with the actual correlation results and have given estimates that reflect a weak to moderate correlation. Their perspectives will help ensure I have a well-rounded view of the data for the next round, potentially leading to a more accurate assessment of the correlation coefficient.

Now, I will proceed to follow these participants.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Scatter Plot

#### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The scatter plot shows a limited number of data points, with most points clustered in the lower range of the Y-axis (between 10 and 30) and a few points extending into the higher Y values (30 to 40).
- The X-axis ranges from approximately 0 to 80, with points distributed primarily between X values of 10 to 70.

#### Step 2: Presence of Visible Trends
- There is no clear linear trend in the data points. The points are scattered without a discernible pattern, and the distribution appears quite random.
- The points do not suggest a strong upward or downward movement, indicating that there is no evident correlation between the X and Y variables.

#### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- Given the random distribution of points, it suggests that one variable does not change predictably with the other. This indicates a very weak correlation.
- Based on this assessment, I would estimate a correlation score of **10** out of 100. This reflects a very weak correlation, acknowledging that while there may be some interaction, it is not significant.

### Confidence in the Result
- I am confident that this score accurately represents the correlation present in the data. The scattered nature of the points supports this estimate, making it likely to be close to the actual correlation value.

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 2:** Chose a correlation score of **60**. This indicates they perceive a moderate to strong correlation, suggesting they see some trends or patterns in the data that I may not have fully recognized.
- **Participant 4:** Chose a correlation score of **10**. This aligns with my estimate and indicates they perceive a very weak correlation, consistent with the random distribution of points in the scatter plot.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My initial estimate of **10** was based on the clear visual assessment of the scatter plot, which showed a random distribution with no discernible trend. Participant 4's agreement reinforces my confidence in this assessment. However, Participant 2's higher estimate suggests that they may have identified some subtle trends that I overlooked.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the responses:
   - \( (60 + 10) / 2 = 35 \)
   - This average suggests a moderate correlation, which is higher than my original estimate of **10**.

### Decision Making:
- The significant difference between Participant 2's and Participant 4's estimates indicates there is disagreement on the correlation strength. Participant 2's score suggests they perceive some correlation that I may have underestimated, while Participant 4's score supports my view of a weak correlation.
- Given that my score of **10** aligns with Participant 4 and is much lower than Participant 2â€™s, I should consider adjusting my estimate upward but remain cautious not to overstate the correlation.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the input from both participants, I will adjust my score to **20**. This reflects a recognition of the potential for some correlation while still indicating that it remains weak.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **20**.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Scatter Plot

#### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The scatter plot shows a total of six data points. 
- Most points are concentrated in the lower range of the Y-axis (between 20 and 25), with one point at approximately 30, and the X-values range from about 30 to 85.

#### Step 2: Presence of Visible Trends
- There does not appear to be a clear linear trend in the data. The points are scattered without a discernible upward or downward pattern.
- The distribution appears somewhat random, indicating that there is no evident correlation between the X and Y variables.

#### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- Given the random distribution of points, it suggests that one variable does not change predictably with the other. Therefore, this indicates a very weak correlation.
- Based on this assessment, I would estimate a correlation score of **10** out of 100. This reflects a very weak correlation, acknowledging that while there may be some interaction, it is not significant.

### Confidence in the Result
- I am confident that this score accurately represents the correlation present in the data. The scattered nature of the points supports this estimate, making it likely to be close to the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit the correlation score of **10**.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 1 chose the value 85
- Participant 2 chose the value 40

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 1:** Chose a correlation score of **85**. This indicates they perceive a very strong correlation, suggesting they see clear trends or patterns in the data that I may not have fully recognized.
- **Participant 2:** Chose a correlation score of **40**. This reflects a moderate correlation perception, indicating they see some relationship between the variables, but not as strong as Participant 1 perceives.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My initial estimate of **10** was based on a clear visual assessment of the scatter plot, which showed a random distribution of points. Participant 2â€™s score aligns more closely with my perception of a weak correlation, while Participant 1â€™s high estimate suggests they are identifying trends that I did not see.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the responses:
   - \( (85 + 40) / 2 = 62.5 \)
   - This average suggests a stronger correlation than my original estimate, indicating a significant difference in perception among the participants.

### Decision Making:
- The substantial difference between Participant 1's and Participant 2's estimates suggests a disagreement on the correlation strength. Participant 1's score indicates they perceive a strong trend, while Participant 2's score suggests a more cautious view.
- Given that my score of **10** aligns more closely with Participant 2, I should consider adjusting my estimate upward but remain cautious about overstating the correlation based on Participant 1's high score.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score to **25**. This reflects a slight acknowledgment of potential correlation while still indicating that it remains weak.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **25**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 1 chose the new value 1 : 50
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 20

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their revised estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 1:** Revised their score to **50**. This indicates they perceive a moderate correlation, which is a significant decrease from their previous estimate of 85. This suggests they may have reconsidered their position based on the scatter plot.
- **Participant 2:** Revised their score to **20**. This indicates they still see a weak correlation but have adjusted their perception slightly upward from their earlier estimate.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **25** was based on the disagreement between the two participants. Participant 1's adjustment to **50** suggests they are recognizing a potential trend or correlation that I may have underestimated. However, Participant 2's score is still at a weak level, indicating that they perceive only a slight relationship.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates from Participants 1 and 2:
   - \( (50 + 20) / 2 = 35 \)
   - This average suggests a moderate correlation, which is higher than my previous estimate of **25**.

### Decision Making:
- The significant decrease in Participant 1's score suggests they are recognizing that the correlation is not as strong as they initially thought. Meanwhile, Participant 2â€™s adjustment reflects a more cautious view of the correlation.
- Given that my estimate was already moderate, I should consider adjusting upward to reflect Participant 1's revised view while also being cautious about the overall randomness observed in the scatter plot.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the input from both participants, I will adjust my score to **30**. This reflects a recognition of the potential for some correlation while still indicating that it remains weak.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **30**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 1 chose the new value 1 : 25
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 25

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the latest updates from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their revised estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 1:** Revised their score to **25**. This indicates they perceive a weak correlation, significantly lower than their previous estimate of 50, suggesting a reconsideration of their initial assessment.
- **Participant 2:** Also revised their score to **25**. This reflects a consistent view between both participants that the correlation is weak.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **30** was based on an acknowledgment of some correlation. However, both participants' revised estimates indicate that they see the correlation as weaker than I had previously assessed. Their agreement at 25 suggests a consensus that I should consider seriously.
2. **Average of Responses:** Since both participants have chosen the same score, it reinforces the belief that the correlation is indeed weak.

### Decision Making:
- The downward revision from both participants suggests that my previous estimate of **30** may have been too optimistic regarding the correlation strength. Their consensus indicates that the correlation is weaker than previously thought.
- Given the data's apparent randomness and the agreement among both participants, it seems prudent to adjust my estimate downward.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score to **25**. This reflects a recognition of the weak correlation while aligning with the participants' consensus.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **25**.

Now, I will proceed to follow these participants.
-------user--------
- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Scatter Plot

#### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The scatter plot shows a dense concentration of points clustered around the X value of approximately 0.5, with Y values ranging from about 0.02 to 0.08.
- Most points are tightly grouped, indicating that there is not much variability in the data.

#### Step 2: Presence of Visible Trends
- The points do not follow a clear linear trend. Instead, they appear to form a vertical clustering, suggesting that the Y variable does not change significantly as the X variable varies.
- This indicates a potential lack of relationship, as the points do not show a clear upward or downward trajectory.

#### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- Given the clustering of points with little to no variation in Y values despite some variation in X values, it suggests that there is no meaningful correlation between the two variables.
- Based on this assessment, I would estimate a correlation score of **5** out of 100. This reflects a very weak correlation, indicating the variables do not change in relation to one another.

### Confidence in the Result
- I am quite confident that this score accurately reflects the correlation present in the data. The clustered nature of the points with minimal variation supports this estimate, making it likely to be close to the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit the correlation score of **5**.
-------user--------

- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 0:** Chose a correlation score of **10**. This indicates they perceive a very weak correlation, which is somewhat aligned with my initial assessment that there is minimal correlation.
- **Participant 4:** Chose a correlation score of **85**. This indicates they see a strong positive correlation, suggesting they have identified trends or patterns in the data that I did not recognize.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My initial estimate of **5** was based on the observation of the clustered nature of the points, which suggested a lack of correlation. Participant 0's agreement supports this view, while Participant 4's significantly higher score indicates a contrasting perspective.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the responses:
   - \( (10 + 85) / 2 = 47.5 \)
   - This average suggests a moderate correlation, which is much higher than my original estimate of **5**.

### Decision Making:
- The substantial difference between Participant 4's estimate and those of Participant 0 and myself indicates a significant disagreement on the correlation strength. Participant 4's score suggests they perceive a strong trend that I may have overlooked, while Participant 0's score aligns with my view of a very weak correlation.
- Given that my original score of **5** aligns with Participant 0's estimate and reflects the observed randomness in the data, I feel confident in maintaining a conservative estimate.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score slightly upward to **10**. This reflects a recognition of the weak correlation while still indicating that it remains low.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **10**.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **10** was based on the observation of the clustered nature of the points, which suggested a lack of correlation. Participant 0's increase to **30** suggests they recognize some potential for correlation, which I may have previously underestimated.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates from Participants 0 and 4:
   - \( (30 + 85) / 2 = 57.5 \)
   - This average suggests a moderate to strong correlation, which is significantly higher than my previous estimate of **10**.

### Decision Making:
- The substantial increase in Participant 0's score indicates they are recognizing a trend that I may have missed, while Participant 4's score reinforces the notion of a strong correlation. This creates a divergence in perspectives that I need to consider carefully.
- While I still believe there is a weak correlation based on the visual evidence, the significant revisions by both participants indicate that I may need to adjust my estimate upwards.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score to **40**. This reflects a recognition of the potential for some correlation while still acknowledging that it remains weak.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **40**.

-------assistant--------
### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Scatter Plot

#### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The scatter plot shows a dense concentration of points in the lower X range (0 to about 1.5) and a gradual decrease in density as X approaches 2.
- Most points are clustered tightly around specific Y values (approximately 18 to 21), with a clear peak in the curve.

#### Step 2: Presence of Visible Trends
- The points follow a non-linear trend, specifically a parabolic shape. As X increases from 0 to around 1.5, Y values increase, reaching a peak before decreasing as X approaches 2.
- This indicates that there is a relationship between the variables, but it is not linear.

#### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- Given the clear parabolic trend, there is a strong correlation between the X and Y variables, but it is not linear. 
- Based on this assessment, I would estimate a correlation score of **75** out of 100. This reflects a strong relationship, acknowledging that while the correlation is present, it does not follow a linear path.

### Confidence in the Result
- I am confident that this score accurately represents the correlation present in the data. The clear parabolic trend and the clustering of points around the curve support this estimate, making it likely to be close to the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit the correlation score of **75**.

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 1:** Chose a correlation score of **5**. This indicates they perceive a very weak correlation, suggesting they see the data points as mostly random with no significant trend.
- **Participant 2:** Chose a correlation score of **15**. This suggests they also see a weak correlation but slightly stronger than Participant 1's view.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My initial estimate of **75** was based on the observation of a clear parabolic trend in the scatter plot. The significant difference between my score and those of both participants indicates a contrasting view of the correlation strength.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the responses:
   - \( (5 + 15) / 2 = 10 \)
   - This average suggests a very weak correlation, which is much lower than my original estimate of **75**.

### Decision Making:
- The substantial difference between my estimate and the participants' scores indicates that I may have overestimated the correlation strength based on my observations.
- Given the agreement between both participants regarding a weak correlation, it would be prudent for me to reconsider my initial score.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score downward to **20**. This reflects a recognition that the correlation may not be as strong as I initially thought, while still acknowledging that there might be some faint relationship between the variables.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **20**.

In analyzing the previous round's results, I will select the following participants to follow in the next round:

### Participants to Follow:
1. **Participant 4 (last answer: 28)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 4's score of 28 is higher than the scores of all the participants I followed, suggesting they see a stronger correlation than the consensus. Their perspective might provide insights into a potential trend in the data that others have missed.

2. **Participant 5 (last answer: 25)**
   - **Reason for Selection:** Participant 5's score of 25 is also higher than the estimates of Participants 1 and 2, indicating they perceive a somewhat stronger correlation. Following them could help balance the views I have been tracking and may provide additional context for the analysis.

### Summary of Strategy:
By following Participants 4 and 5, I aim to gather insights from participants who see a stronger correlation than what I and the other participants have perceived.

-------assistant--------
### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Scatter Plot

#### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The scatter plot shows a total of six data points.
- The points are mostly clustered around the lower X values (0 to 50) and a few are located at higher X values (80 to 100).
- The Y-values range from about -50 to 100, with the majority of points concentrated near the lower Y values.

#### Step 2: Presence of Visible Trends
- There appears to be a non-linear trend in the scatter plot. As X increases from around 0 to about 50, there is a noticeable increase in Y values, suggesting some positive relationship.
- However, the relationship seems to flatten out as X approaches 100, indicating a potential plateau rather than a continuous increase.

#### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- Given the overall distribution and the visible trend, I would estimate a moderate correlation score.
- While there is a discernible upward trend, the scatter of points, especially at the higher X values, indicates that the correlation is not very strong.
- Based on this assessment, I would assign a correlation score of **60** out of 100. This reflects a moderate relationship, recognizing that while there is some correlation, it is not particularly strong due to the scatter and the plateau effect.

### Confidence in the Result
- I am reasonably confident that this score accurately reflects the correlation present in the data. The visible trend and the distribution of points support this estimate, making it likely to be close to the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit the correlation score of **60**.

- **Participant 4:** Chose a correlation score of **5**. This indicates they perceive a very weak correlation, suggesting they see the data points as mostly random with minimal trend.
- **Participant 5:** Chose a correlation score of **60**. This indicates they perceive a moderate correlation, which aligns with my initial estimate, suggesting they see some positive relationship in the data.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My initial estimate of **60** was based on the observation of an upward trend in the scatter plot. Participant 5's agreement with this score supports my confidence in this assessment. However, Participant 4's much lower score indicates a contrasting view, suggesting they see the data as having little to no correlation.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the responses:
   - \( (5 + 60) / 2 = 32.5 \)
   - This average suggests a weak correlation, which is significantly lower than my original estimate of **60**.

### Decision Making:
- The significant difference between my estimate and those of both participants indicates a contrasting view of the correlation strength. Participant 5 supports my view of a moderate correlation, while Participant 4's score suggests a very weak correlation.
- Given that my score of **60** aligns with Participant 5 but diverges significantly from Participant 4, I should consider adjusting my estimate downward to reflect the more cautious perspective presented.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score to **40**. This reflects a recognition of the potential for some correlation while still indicating that it is not strong due to the perspective of Participant 4.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **40**.

Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 15
- Participant 5 chose the new value 5 : 25

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.

Given the latest updates from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their revised estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 4:** Revised their score to **15**. This indicates they perceive a very weak correlation, suggesting they see the data points as mostly random with minimal trend.
- **Participant 5:** Revised their score to **25**. This suggests they see a slightly stronger correlation than Participant 4 but still consider it weak.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **40** was based on the observation of an upward trend in the scatter plot. Participant 5's increase to **25** indicates they recognize some correlation, albeit weak. Participant 4's score of **15** aligns with a more cautious view of the correlation.
2. **Average of Responses:** Taking the average of the new estimates from Participants 4 and 5:
   - \( (15 + 25) / 2 = 20 \)
   - This average suggests a weak correlation, which is lower than my previous estimate of **40**.

### Decision Making:
- The downward revisions from both participants suggest that I may have overestimated the correlation strength based on my observations. The consensus indicates that the correlation is weaker than I initially assessed.
- Given the input from both participants and the average response, I should adjust my estimate downward.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the feedback from both participants, I will adjust my score to **20**. This reflects a recognition of the weak correlation while aligning with the participants' current estimates.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **20**.

Given the latest updates from the participants I am following, I will reassess my correlation score based on their revised estimates:

### Participant Responses:
- **Participant 4:** Revised their score to **10**. This indicates they perceive a weak correlation, suggesting they see the data points as mostly random with minimal trend.
- **Participant 5:** Also revised their score to **10**. This further reinforces the view of a very weak correlation.

### Analyzing the Responses:
1. **Confidence Level:** My previous estimate of **20** was based on a recognition of some potential correlation. However, both participants' significant downward revisions indicate they see minimal correlation, which aligns with a more cautious perspective on the data.
2. **Average of Responses:** Since both participants have chosen the same score:
   - The average is simply \(10\), which suggests a very weak correlation.

### Decision Making:
- The agreement between both participants indicates a strong consensus that the correlation is weak. Their consistent scores suggest that I may have overestimated the strength of the relationship in my previous assessment.
- Given their feedback, it is prudent for me to also adjust my estimate downward to reflect their consensus.

### Revised Estimate:
Considering the input from both participants, I will adjust my score to **10**. This reflects a recognition of the weak correlation while aligning with the participants' current estimates.

Now, I will submit the revised correlation score of **10**.
