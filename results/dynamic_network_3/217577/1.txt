Context :
- You are participating in an economic experiment. 
- You are an average human and should mimick its guessing capabilities
- Your task is to analyze an image and estimate what is called a correlation coefficient. 
- Points will be scattered all arround the image
- A straight line will mean 100% correlation between points, points scattered everywhere 0%
- You will potentially have the possibility to see other participants responses and revise your answer
-------user--------
- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points in the scatter plot are quite spread out, with some concentration toward the lower values of the x-axis and others at higher values. 
   - There seems to be a grouping of points in the lower left quadrant and a few points higher up on the y-axis, indicating a somewhat uneven distribution.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - At first glance, there does not appear to be a clear linear trend. Points are scattered in such a way that some higher y-values do not correspond to higher x-values.
   - The points seem to form an overall non-linear pattern, as there are no points that suggest a strong increase or decrease.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Given that the points do not cluster around a straight line and exhibit a random distribution, the correlation between the x and y variables appears weak.
   - The spread indicates that changes in one variable do not consistently lead to changes in the other variable.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **20** out of 100. This low score reflects the weak correlation observed.

### Confidence Level
I am moderately confident in this correlation score. The distribution of points suggests minimal correlation, but the exact value could vary slightly depending on more nuanced interpretations of the data's arrangement. However, the overall lack of a visible trend supports the score assigned. 

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 0 chose the value 5
- Participant 2 chose the value 60

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the additional responses from the other participants, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Participant 0 (Value 5)**:
   - This participant has chosen a very low correlation score, which suggests they see almost no correlation between the variables. This aligns somewhat with my original assessment, considering the scattered nature of the points. It indicates a possible agreement on the weak correlation aspect.

2. **Participant 2 (Value 60)**:
   - This score is relatively high compared to both mine and Participant 0's. It suggests that Participant 2 perceives a stronger correlation or a more defined trend in the scatter plot. This perspective differs significantly from mine and may indicate they see some form of pattern that I did not recognize.

### Thought Process:
- The consensus between my score of 20 and Participant 0's score of 5 suggests a generally low correlation perception among us.
- However, Participant 2's score of 60 raises questions about the presence of a trend that I may have overlooked.
- My original score of 20 was based on the clearly scattered distribution of points, and I still feel that it reflects a weak correlation. 

### Decision:
Considering the low scores from myself and Participant 0, and acknowledging Participant 2's differing view, I still feel confident in maintaining a low correlation score. However, to reflect a slight adjustment based on the participation of others and an acknowledgment of the differing perspectives, I will revise my score to **30**. This score indicates a weak correlation while also accounting for the variation in opinions among participants.

I will now submit this revised correlation score.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 30
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 60

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Analyzing the revised choices from the participants:

1. **Participant 0 (New Value 0)**:
   - This participant has revised their score to 0, indicating they now believe there is no correlation at all between the variables. This aligns closely with the initial analysis that pointed towards very weak or potentially no correlation.

2. **Participant 2 (New Value 2)**:
   - Participant 2 has also significantly lowered their score to 2, suggesting they are now leaning towards a very weak correlation. This is a substantial change from their previous score of 60 and indicates they are recognizing the scattered nature of the points more clearly.

### Thought Process:
- The shift in both participants towards very low correlation scores reinforces the idea that the data points do not exhibit a clear relationship.
- Participant 0's move to 0 suggests a strong consensus on the idea that there is essentially no correlation, which I had hesitated to declare outright in my previous score.
- Participant 2’s adjustment to 2 indicates a recognition of minimal correlation, which aligns with the overall consensus forming among the participants.

### Decision:
Considering the strong alignment with Participant 0's and Participant 2's new scores, I will further adjust my score to **5**. This score reflects the recognition of an extremely weak correlation, aligning more closely with the sentiment expressed by the other participants while still acknowledging that there may be very slight relationships present.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 10
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 40

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Let’s analyze the new responses from the participants:

1. **Participant 0 (New Value 0)**:
   - Participant 0 has chosen 0 again, which reinforces their belief that there is no correlation at all. This strong stance suggests they are very confident in their assessment that the data points are completely uncorrelated.

2. **Participant 2 (New Value 40)**:
   - Participant 2 has adjusted their score to 40. This indicates they see a somewhat stronger correlation than previously, which is a notable increase from their last score of 2. This suggests they may perceive some form of trend or relationship among the data points, which I may still be underestimating.

### Thought Process:
- The consensus from Participant 0 strongly suggests that there is no correlation, while Participant 2's revision indicates a more nuanced perspective. 
- Since my previous score of 5 was largely influenced by Participant 0 and did not account for any potential patterns that Participant 2 might see, I need to reconsider my approach.
- Given the stark difference between Participant 0’s complete lack of correlation and Participant 2’s belief in a weak correlation, I need to find a middle ground that represents the general sentiment while acknowledging Participant 2’s perspective.

### Decision:
In light of this, I will adjust my score to **10**. This score acknowledges a very low correlation, reflecting Participant 0's strong stance while also considering that Participant 2 sees some potential for correlation.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.

- You can choose up to 2 participants.

-------assistant--------
Analyzing the results from the previous round, here's a breakdown of the participants' guesses:

1. **Participant 0 (Last Answer: 20)**:
   - Participant 0's score increased from 0 to 20, indicating a shift in perspective towards recognizing some very weak correlation. They seem to be more aligned with the general sentiment of low correlation, which reflects the overall data pattern. Following Participant 0 may provide insight into the lowest correlation perspectives.

2. **Participant 2 (Last Answer: 30)**:
   - Participant 2's score also increased from 2 to 30, showing that they are acknowledging a bit more correlation than before. Their perspective is valuable as they may perceive a slightly stronger relationship than the other participants, and their adjustments suggest they are actively reconsidering their position based on collective inputs.

3. **Participant 3 (Last Answer: 15)**:
   - Participant 3’s score of 15 places them in a similar range to Participant 0's and Participant 2's updated scores. They seem to maintain a low but slightly more optimistic view of correlation than Participant 0.

4. **Participant 4 (Last Answer: 10)**:
   - Participant 4 maintained a score of 10, which is close to my last score. This participant's perspective is consistent with my own, reflecting a very low correlation.

5. **Participant 5 (Last Answer: 15)**:
   - Like Participant 3, Participant 5’s score aligns with the low correlation sentiment but leans slightly higher.

### Selection Strategy:
Given this analysis, I will choose to follow:

- **Participant 0**: They represent a perspective of very low correlation, and their recent adjustment indicates they are receptive to changes in the data interpretation. Their insights can help refine the understanding of the lower end of the correlation spectrum.

- **Participant 2**: They have shown the most significant increase in their score and may provide a balanced view of weak correlation, which could align more closely with the true nature of the data. Their willingness to adjust their score indicates they are thoughtfully engaging with the data.

Following these two participants will allow me to gauge both the very low correlation perspective and a slightly more optimistic view, which can help inform my next guess more effectively. 

I will now submit my selection.

- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are scattered across the plot, with a noticeable clustering of several points in the upper right quadrant (near x = 80-100 and y = 25-35) and a few points in the lower left quadrant (around x = 10-30 and y = 15-20).
   - This distribution indicates that while there are groups of points, they are not uniformly spread across the entire range.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is no clear linear trend visible at first glance. The points in the upper right do not appear to follow a consistent upward or downward slope when compared to the points in the lower left.
   - The clustering suggests a possible non-linear relationship, but it does not seem strong enough to indicate a reliable pattern.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - The points that are clustered in the upper right quadrant seem isolated from those in the lower left quadrant, indicating that one variable does not consistently change in relation to the other.
   - The presence of two distinct groups (one low and one high) suggests a weak correlation overall.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **15** out of 100. This score reflects a very weak correlation, indicating that while some points are grouped, the overall relationship remains unclear.

### Confidence Level
I am moderately confident in this correlation score. The scattered nature of the points and the lack of a clear trend support the assigned score, but the presence of two clusters might suggest that there could be some relationship not immediately visible. However, given the data, I believe the score of 15 is a fair representation of the correlation's strength. 

Now, I will submit this correlation score.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 0 chose the value 85
- Participant 2 chose the value 40

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the responses from the participants I chose to follow:

1. **Participant 0 (Value 85)**:
   - This score indicates a very high correlation, suggesting they perceive a strong linear relationship between the variables. This contrasts sharply with my assessment, indicating that Participant 0 may be interpreting the data in a significantly different way.

2. **Participant 2 (Value 40)**:
   - This score reflects a moderate perception of correlation, indicating that Participant 2 sees some relationship between the variables but not as strong as Participant 0. This is closer to my initial assessment but still higher than my score of 15.

### Thought Process:
- The stark contrast between Participant 0's high score and my own score suggests a significant divergence in interpreting the scatter plot. Participant 0 may be identifying a trend or pattern that I did not see, and their confidence in a high correlation raises questions about my original assessment.
- Participant 2’s score of 40 suggests they might see some correlation, but not nearly as strong as Participant 0 perceives. Their response indicates a more cautious recognition of correlation compared to Participant 0.

### Decision:
Given the wide range of estimates, I need to reassess my position. Participant 0's score of 85 may be based on a perceived non-linear relationship that I overlooked, but I still feel confident that there isn't a clear linear trend. 

To reflect both the consensus of low correlation from my previous assessment and acknowledge the differing perspectives of the other participants, I will adjust my score to **25**. This score suggests a very weak correlation while accommodating the higher estimates from Participant 2.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 70
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 80

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants

- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Analyzing the updated responses from the participants I chose to follow:

1. **Participant 0 (New Value 70)**:
   - This score indicates that Participant 0 sees a relatively strong correlation in the data. Their increase from 85 to 70 signifies an adjustment but still reflects a belief that there is a trend worth noting, even if it is not as strong as initially thought.

2. **Participant 2 (New Value 80)**:
   - Participant 2’s score of 80 suggests they have a very high perception of correlation, indicating they see a clear relationship between the variables. This is a significant increase from their previous score of 40, suggesting a strong conviction in a visible trend.

### Thought Process:
- The adjustments in scores from both participants indicate a notable shift towards recognizing a high correlation, which contrasts starkly with my own assessment of a very weak correlation.
- Participant 0’s score of 70 reflects a shift toward acknowledging a trend, while Participant 2’s score of 80 suggests a strong belief in correlation that I may not have fully recognized.

### Decision:
Given the substantial increases in their scores and the confidence both participants now exhibit in the correlation, I need to reconsider my stance. However, I still hold reservations about the very high scores they are assigning, as my original assessment was based on the scattered nature of the points.

To balance the perspectives and reflect my belief in some correlation while acknowledging the insights from Participants 0 and 2, I will adjust my score to **40**. This score indicates a weak correlation but recognizes the stronger perceptions of correlation from the other participants.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.

Let’s analyze the new responses from the participants I chose to follow:

1. **Participant 0 (New Value 60)**:
   - This score indicates that Participant 0 perceives a moderate correlation in the data. Their adjustment from 70 to 60 suggests they have reconsidered their view, but still believe there is a significant trend present.

2. **Participant 2 (New Value 75)**:
   - Participant 2's score of 75 suggests they maintain a strong belief in correlation. This reflects a slight decrease from their previous score of 80, indicating they may have tempered their initial enthusiasm but still see a notable relationship between the variables.

### Thought Process:
- The updates from both participants indicate a strong tendency toward believing there is some level of correlation in the data, which contrasts with my previous assessment of a weak correlation. 
- Participant 0’s score reflects a more cautious approach, while Participant 2 still holds a strong belief in the correlation, indicating differing perspectives among the participants.

### Decision:
Given the latest scores, I need to adjust my position again. While I have been cautious about overestimating the correlation based on the scattered nature of the points, the consistent upward trend in the scores from both participants indicates a need to acknowledge the potential for correlation more than I previously have.

To find a balance between my perspective and the stronger views of the other participants, I will adjust my score to **50**. This score reflects a moderate belief in correlation, acknowledging the insights from Participants 0 and 2 while still being cautious about the overall trends in the data.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.

2. **Participant 2 (Last Answer: 55)**:
   - Participant 2 slightly increased their score from 75 to 55, indicating that they are still optimistic about the correlation, but they have tempered their view. This suggests they are reevaluating their stance based on the most recent information.

3. **Participant 3 (Last Answer: 40)**:
   - Participant 3’s score of 40 shows a more cautious view of correlation. This perspective may be valuable as it leans towards a lower estimate, which could provide a more conservative viewpoint.

4. **Participant 4 (Last Answer: 35)**:
   - Participant 4’s score of 35 indicates they are even more conservative in their assessment of correlation. Their lower score can help balance out the more optimistic views of Participants 0 and 2.

5. **Participant 5 (Last Answer: 35)**:
   - Participant 5 has the same score as Participant 4, indicating a consistent cautious approach to assessing correlation. Their perspective aligns well with Participant 4.

### Selection Strategy:
Given the latest scores and the overall trend, I will choose to follow:

- **Participant 0**: Their consistent score of 50 reflects a moderate correlation perspective, which aligns well with my own adjustments and can help maintain a balanced view in the next round.

- **Participant 3**: Their score of 40 represents a more conservative viewpoint, which can provide a valuable counterbalance to the more optimistic perspectives of Participant 0 and Participant 2. This will help ensure that my assessment does not lean too heavily towards overestimating the correlation.

Following these two participants will allow me to gauge both moderate and cautious perspectives, which can help inform a more balanced estimate in the next round.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are relatively evenly distributed, showing a clear upward trend from the lower left to the upper right. The data points range from around x = 10 to x = 110 and y = 20 to y = 34.
   - There are no significant gaps in the data, and the points seem to cluster along a path rather than being randomly scattered.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is a visible linear trend in the data points. As the x-values increase, the y-values also increase, suggesting a direct relationship between the two variables.
   - The points form a pattern that closely resembles a straight line, indicating a strong linear correlation.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Given the clear upward trend and the relatively close alignment of the points to a straight line, one can infer that as the x-variable increases, the y-variable consistently increases as well.
   - This alignment suggests a strong correlation between x and y.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **85** out of 100. This score reflects a strong correlation, indicating that there is a reliable linear relationship visible in the data.

### Confidence Level
I am quite confident in this correlation score. The clear linear trend and the proximity of the points to an imaginary line strongly support the assigned score, indicating a high likelihood that the score is close to the actual correlation value.

- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are relatively clustered, with most of them gathering in the lower-middle section of the plot (around x = 0 to x = 60 and y = 15 to y = 30). There are a couple of points that stand out, particularly one at a higher x-value (around x = 85) and a y-value around 25.
   - The distribution shows a concentration of points, but also some spread towards higher x-values without corresponding y-value increases.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There appears to be a non-linear trend where y increases as x increases, but it is not perfectly linear. The points seem to form a loose upward curve.
   - The presence of the outlier at x = 85 does not strongly follow the trend established by the other points, indicating it may not represent a strong linear relationship.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - The clustering of points suggests that there is some correlation, but the presence of a few outliers and the non-linear appearance of the data points indicates that the correlation is not particularly strong.
   - The overall trend suggests a moderate correlation, but the deviation of some points from this trend line suggests that changes in one variable do not consistently lead to proportional changes in the other variable.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **60** out of 100. This score reflects a moderate correlation, indicating a relationship is present, but it is not strong or linear.

### Confidence Level
I am moderately confident in this correlation score. The clustering of points supports the assigned score, but the presence of outliers and the non-linear nature of the data suggests some uncertainty. Therefore, while I believe 60 is a reasonable estimate, there could be variations in the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the responses from the participants I chose to follow:

1. **Participant 2 (Value 10)**:
   - This score reflects a very low perception of correlation, indicating that Participant 2 sees almost no relationship between the variables. This perspective is significantly lower than my estimate of 60, suggesting they view the data points as being scattered without a clear trend.

2. **Participant 5 (Value 5)**:
   - Participant 5's score of 5 reinforces the idea of weak correlation. Similar to Participant 2, they perceive that the variables do not have a strong relationship, indicating skepticism about any correlation.

### Thought Process:
- The scores from both participants suggest a consensus towards a very weak correlation, which contrasts sharply with my assessment of a moderate correlation (60). 
- Their low scores indicate that they perceive the data points as lacking a clear trend, likely due to the presence of outliers and the non-linear arrangement of points.
- Given this strong divergence in perspectives, I need to reconsider my initial estimate. While I believe there is some correlation present, their scores indicate that it may be much weaker than I originally thought.

### Decision:
Considering the strong consensus among Participants 2 and 5 for very low correlation, I will adjust my score downwards to **20**. This score reflects a recognition of a very weak correlation while still acknowledging that there may be some relationship present, albeit not strong.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.

Let’s analyze the updated responses from the participants I chose to follow:

1. **Participant 2 (New Value 30)**:
   - Participant 2 has increased their score to 30, suggesting they now see a slightly stronger correlation than their previous score of 10. This indicates a shift in their perception, possibly recognizing some relationship that they initially overlooked.

2. **Participant 5 (New Value 5)**:
   - Participant 5 has maintained a very low score of 5, indicating they still perceive almost no correlation between the variables. This reflects a consistent skepticism about any relationship present in the data.

### Thought Process:
- The change in Participant 2’s score to 30 suggests that they are acknowledging a minimal correlation, which is closer to my previous assessment. However, Participant 5’s score remains low, suggesting they still do not see any significant relationship.
- The divergence in scores indicates that while there may be some consensus moving towards recognizing a weak correlation, there is still significant skepticism from Participant 5.

### Decision:
Considering the updated scores, I will adjust my correlation score to **25**. This score reflects a very weak correlation while acknowledging Participant 2's increased perception of correlation, but also aligns closely with Participant 5’s continued skepticism. It strikes a balance between acknowledging a minimal relationship and recognizing that the correlation is not strong.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.

2. **Participant 5 (New Value 10)**:
   - Participant 5 has increased their score to 10, which is still quite low but indicates they are now acknowledging at least a minimal correlation. This reflects a slight shift in their perspective, though they remain skeptical about the strength of the correlation.

### Thought Process:
- The increase in Participant 2’s score to 55 suggests they see a clearer relationship than previously thought, while Participant 5’s score of 10 indicates a recognition that there is some correlation, albeit weak.
- The divergence in scores indicates a potential consensus moving towards recognizing a moderate correlation, especially from Participant 2, while still reflecting skepticism from Participant 5.

### Decision:

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are spread across the plot, with a notable concentration of several points in the upper section (around x = 0 to x = 80 and y = 20 to y = 100).
   - There are also a few points in the lower section, particularly at lower x-values and negative y-values.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is no clear linear trend visible. The points in the upper section do not follow a consistent upward or downward slope when compared to the points in the lower section.
   - The scattered nature of the points suggests a non-linear relationship, and the presence of outliers (especially those in the negative y-range) indicates that the correlation may be quite weak.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - The points that are clustered in the upper region do not appear to correlate well with those in the lower region. This indicates that the changes in x do not lead to consistent changes in y.
   - Given the scattered arrangement and lack of a distinct trend, the overall correlation appears weak.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **15** out of 100. This score reflects a very weak correlation, indicating that while some points are grouped, the overall relationship remains unclear.

### Confidence Level
I am moderately confident in this score. The scattered nature of the points and the lack of a clear trend support the assigned score, but there could be variability in the actual correlation based on different interpretations of the data.

Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are scattered across the plot, with a relatively uniform distribution. There is a noticeable concentration of points in the range of x-values between 0 and 60 and y-values between 0 and 40.
   - There are also points extending into higher x-values (up to 100) and a few points with negative y-values, but most of the data is clustered in the lower to middle ranges.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is no clear linear trend visible in the data. The points do not form a recognizable line, and while there seems to be some clustering in the lower ranges, the overall arrangement appears random.
   - The scatter suggests a potential non-linear relationship; however, it is not strong enough to indicate a clear correlation.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - The scattered nature of the points indicates that changes in one variable do not consistently lead to proportional changes in the other variable.
   - Given the lack of a distinct trend or strong clustering, the overall correlation appears to be weak.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **10** out of 100. This score reflects a very weak correlation, indicating that while some points are grouped, the overall relationship remains unclear.

   - The points appear to follow a somewhat linear path, suggesting that higher values of x are associated with higher values of y.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - The strong clustering of points along an upward trend suggests a strong correlation between the two variables. As x increases, y consistently increases, indicating a direct relationship.
   - The overall pattern indicates that changes in one variable are likely to lead to changes in the other, reinforcing the idea of a strong correlation.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **85** out of 100. This score reflects a strong correlation, indicating a reliable linear relationship observed in the data.

### Confidence Level
I am quite confident in this correlation score. The clear linear trend and the proximity of the points to a straight line strongly support the assigned score, indicating a high likelihood that the score is close to the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are widely scattered throughout the plot, with no particular concentration in any specific area. The x-values range from about -20 to 120, while the y-values extend from -300 to 400.
   - There is a noticeable spread across the entire range, suggesting a random distribution of points with no significant clustering.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is no clear linear trend visible. The data points do not form a recognizable line or shape, indicating a lack of consistent upward or downward movement.
   - The distribution appears to be more random, with some points in the higher y-values not corresponding to higher x-values.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Given the scattered nature of the points and the absence of a visible trend, the correlation between the x and y variables appears to be very weak.
   - The lack of a consistent relationship means that changes in one variable do not reliably lead to changes in the other.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **5** out of 100. This score reflects an extremely weak correlation, indicating that while there might be some minimal relationships present, they are not strong or consistent.

### Confidence Level
I am quite confident in this score. The random distribution of points and the lack of a clear trend strongly support the assigned score, indicating a high likelihood that the score is close to the actual correlation value.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the responses from the participants I chose to follow:

1. **Participant 3 (Value 75)**:
   - This score suggests that Participant 3 perceives a strong correlation in the data. Their view contrasts sharply with my assessment of 5, indicating they see a clear relationship between the variables.

2. **Participant 0 (Value 80)**:
   - Participant 0's score of 80 also indicates a very strong correlation. This score is significantly higher than my own assessment and suggests they believe there is a strong linear relationship present.

### Thought Process:
- The stark contrast between my score of 5 and the much higher scores from both participants suggests a fundamental difference in the interpretation of the scatter plot.
- Participant 3 and Participant 0 are indicating that there is a strong trend in the data that I may not have fully recognized, possibly due to the scattered nature of the points. Their high scores imply they see a positive relationship that I have not observed.

### Decision:
Given the considerable divergence in perspectives, I need to reassess my position. While I maintain that the data appears random and lacks a clear correlation, the confidence shown by Participants 3 and 0 suggests there may be more to the relationship than I initially perceived.

To find a middle ground while still reflecting my cautious view, I will adjust my score to **25**. This score reflects a very weak correlation but acknowledges the possibility of some relationship present, as perceived by the other participants.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.

2. **Participant 0 (New Value 15)**:
   - Participant 0 has decreased their score to 15, reflecting an even lower perception of correlation. Their view suggests they see a clear lack of strong relationship between the variables.

### Thought Process:
- The changes in both participants’ scores indicate a shift toward recognizing a very weak correlation. Participant 3's score of 25 suggests they acknowledge some relationship, albeit minimal, while Participant 0's score of 15 signifies a belief in a very weak or negligible correlation.
- Given that both scores are low, this reinforces the idea that the scatter plot does not show a strong relationship between the variables, which aligns with my initial assessment.

Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points in the scatter plot are fairly evenly distributed across the x-axis, ranging from about -20 to 120, and the y-axis ranges from about -150 to 150.
   - There is a noticeable spread, but the points do not cluster significantly in any specific area, suggesting a random distribution.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There does not appear to be a clear linear trend. The data points are scattered without forming a recognizable line or curve.
   - The points seem to depict a random distribution, indicating that there is no consistent relationship between the x and y variables.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Given the scattered nature of the points and the lack of a visible trend, the correlation between the x and y variables appears to be very weak.
   - The absence of a consistent pattern suggests that changes in one variable do not reliably lead to changes in the other.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **5** out of 100. This score reflects an extremely weak correlation, indicating that while there might be minimal relationships present, they are not strong or consistent.

### Confidence Level

### Thought Process:
- The stark contrast between Participant 4's score and Participant 3's score highlights differing interpretations of the scatter plot. While Participant 4's view reflects a consensus with my own perspective of very weak correlation, Participant 3's higher score suggests they observe a trend that I may not have fully recognized.
- Given that Participant 4 aligns with my assessment, this reinforces my confidence in the score of 5. However, I must consider Participant 3's perspective, which indicates that there could be more to the relationship than I initially perceived.

### Decision:
Given the significant divergence in perspectives, I will maintain my score at **5**. This reflects my assessment of an extremely weak correlation while acknowledging that there may be differing views on the strength of the relationship.

I will now submit this correlation score.

Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 15
- Participant 3 chose the new value 3 : 40

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.

Let’s analyze the updated responses from the participants I chose to follow:

1. **Participant 4 (New Value 15)**:
   - Participant 4 has increased their score to 15, indicating they perceive a slightly stronger correlation than before. This suggests they may have reevaluated their perspective based on further reflection on the scatter plot.

2. **Participant 3 (New Value 40)**:
   - Participant 3 has raised their score to 40, indicating they see a moderate correlation. This score is significantly higher than their previous assessment and suggests they recognize a clearer relationship in the data.

### Thought Process:
- The changes in both participants’ scores indicate a shift towards recognizing a weak to moderate correlation. Participant 4's increase suggests they are acknowledging some relationship, while Participant 3's score suggests a more substantial view of correlation than previously assessed.
- The divergence between Participant 4 and Participant 3 shows that while both see some relationship, their assessments differ significantly in strength.

### Decision:
Considering the updated scores and the perspectives of both participants, I will adjust my correlation score to **20**. This score acknowledges the minimal correlation suggested by Participant 4 while also considering the more optimistic view from Participant 3.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.

Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 10
- Participant 3 chose the new value 3 : 20

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.

Let’s analyze the updated responses from the participants I chose to follow:

1. **Participant 4 (New Value 10)**:
   - Participant 4 has decreased their score to 10, indicating they perceive an even weaker correlation than before. This suggests they are recognizing that the relationship between the variables is minimal.

2. **Participant 3 (New Value 20)**:
   - Participant 3 has kept their score at 20, indicating they still perceive a very weak correlation. Their score reflects a modest acknowledgment of some relationship, but it remains low.

### Thought Process:
- The adjustments from both participants indicate a shift toward recognizing a very weak correlation. Participant 4's decrease to 10 shows a clear acknowledgment of the lack of a strong relationship, while Participant 3's score of 20 suggests they continue to see some minimal correlation.
- The scores from both participants suggest a consensus moving towards a recognition that the correlation is very weak, which aligns with my earlier assessments.

### Decision:
Considering the updated scores and the cautious sentiment from both participants, I will adjust my correlation score to **15**. This score reflects a very weak correlation, acknowledging that while there may be some minimal relationships present, they are not strong.

I will now submit this adjusted correlation score.
