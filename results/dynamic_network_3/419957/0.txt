Context :
- You are participating in an economic experiment. 
- You are an average human and should mimick its guessing capabilities
- Your task is to analyze an image and estimate what is called a correlation coefficient. 
- Points will be scattered all arround the image
- A straight line will mean 100% correlation between points, points scattered everywhere 0%
- You will potentially have the possibility to see other participants responses and revise your answer
-------user--------
- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, I'll break down the thought process into several key points:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points appear to be quite scattered across the plot. There is no significant clustering in any specific area, which indicates a diverse distribution.
   - The density of points does not seem to show any particular grouping or concentration pattern; they are fairly uniformly distributed throughout the range of X and Y values.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - Upon examining the points, there are no visible trends that suggest a linear relationship between the X and Y variables. 
   - The points seem to be randomly distributed without any discernible upward or downward slope.

3. **Correlation Assessment**:
   - Given that the points are scattered with no apparent trend or pattern, it suggests that changes in one variable (X) do not correspond to predictable changes in the other variable (Y).
   - This leads to the conclusion that there is a very weak correlation, potentially close to zero.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **5**. This reflects a very weak correlation, indicating that there is almost no relationship between the two variables.

4. **Confidence in the Result**:
   - I feel fairly confident in this score being close to the actual value, primarily because the scatter plot does not exhibit any clear trends or relationships that would signify a stronger correlation.

Now, I will submit the correlation score.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 2 chose the value 60
- Participant 5 chose the value 65

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Considering the responses from Participants 2 and 5, who both chose significantly higher values (60 and 65), I will re-evaluate my initial assessment:

1. **Comparison to Other Participants**:
   - Participants 2 and 5 suggest a moderate correlation, which contrasts sharply with my initial estimate of 5. Their scores indicate that they see some level of relationship between the variables that I may have overlooked.

2. **Re-evaluating the Scatter Plot**:
   - While I initially perceived the points as scattered with no clear trend, it's possible that there are subtler patterns or clusters that could indicate a weak correlation.
   - The absence of an obvious linear trend does not rule out the possibility of a weak to moderate correlation. There could be non-linear relationships or other factors affecting the distribution of points that I might not have fully considered.

3. **Confidence Level**:
   - Although I initially felt confident in my score, the substantial divergence in responses from other participants suggests that I should be more cautious about my assessment.
   - My confidence in my original score has decreased, and I should consider adjusting my estimate to align more closely with the average of the other participants' scores.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - Given the other participants' scores and a reassessment of the scatter plot, I will choose a value that reflects a weak to moderate correlation. A score of **35** seems appropriate, as it acknowledges the possibility of some correlation without fully aligning with the higher estimates of other participants.

Now, I will submit this adjusted correlation score.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 62
- Participant 5 chose the new value 5 : 30

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Considering the new responses from Participants 2 and 5, I will reassess my estimate again based on the following points:

1. **New Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 2 adjusted their score to **62**, suggesting they believe there is a moderate correlation between the variables.
   - Participant 5 reduced their score to **30**, indicating they perceive a very weak correlation.

2. **Analyzing the Divergence**:
   - There is still a notable divergence between the two participants' scores. Participant 2's score suggests a stronger belief in correlation versus Participant 5's more cautious estimate.
   - This spread indicates uncertainty in the data, with a tendency toward differing interpretations of the scatter plot.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous score of **35** leaned towards a weak correlation based on my initial observations of the scatter plot. However, the adjustments from other participants indicate a potential for reevaluation.
   - Given that Participant 2’s score is higher, it suggests that there may be some aspect of the plot indicating a relationship that I could have underestimated.

4. **Finding a Middle Ground**:
   - Balancing between the two new scores, I feel that a score around **40** would reflect a cautious but slightly more optimistic perspective on the correlation. This score acknowledges the potential for some correlation without fully committing to Participant 2’s higher estimate.

In light of this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **40**. Now, I will submit this new value.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 35
- Participant 5 chose the new value 5 : 10

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from Participants 2 and 5, I will reassess my estimate once again based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 2 has adjusted their score to **35**, indicating a belief in a weak correlation.
   - Participant 5 has significantly reduced their score to **10**, suggesting they perceive almost no correlation at all.

2. **Assessing the Shift in Scores**:
   - The downward adjustments from both participants indicate a trend towards recognizing a very weak correlation, aligning more closely with my initial instincts about the scatter plot.
   - This shift suggests that upon further reflection, both participants may have recognized the lack of a strong relationship between the variables.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous score of **40** may have been overly optimistic in light of the new adjustments. The consensus now appears to lean towards a very weak correlation.
   - I need to balance my own observations with the updates from my peers. With Participant 2’s score at **35** and Participant 5’s at **10**, it may be prudent to adjust my score downward.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - Considering the trend towards lower scores and the overall context of the scatter plot, I feel a score of **20** would accurately reflect a very weak correlation while still being slightly more optimistic than Participant 5’s score of 10.

Based on this analysis, I will choose a correlation score of **20**. Now, I will submit this new value.
-------user--------
This round(1), your final choice was the value 20. The exact result was 9.0
/n
Here are the last answers of the participants you followed this round:
- Participant 2 last answer was 12
- Participant 5 last answer was 15

Here are the answers of the participants you did not follow this round:
- Participant 1 last answer was 20
- Participant 3 last answer was 25
- Participant 4 last answer was 30

For the next round, you can choose which participants' guessed values you want to follow.
- Carefully analyze the previous round's results.
- Identify participants whose guesses are most relevant to your strategy.
- Explain why you are choosing each participant.
- You can choose up to 2 participants.

-------assistant--------
In the previous round, my final choice was 20, which was closer to the lower estimates from Participants 2 and 5, but still significantly above the actual result of 9.0. 

Now, I will evaluate which participants to follow in the next round based on their last guesses and their proximity to the actual result:

1. **Participant 2 (last answer: 12)**:
   - Participant 2's last estimate was 12, which is relatively close to the actual result of 9.0. Their adjustments indicate that they are willing to reconsider their estimates based on the evolving conversation and may have a good sense of the correlation based on the scatter plot.
   - Following Participant 2 could provide valuable insights into estimating a correlation score that is more in line with the actual data.

2. **Participant 5 (last answer: 15)**:
   - Participant 5's last estimate was 15, which is also close to the actual result of 9.0. Their score reflects a cautious approach and suggests they are recognizing the weak correlation in the data.
   - Following Participant 5 would give me an additional perspective that is aligned with the lower estimates, allowing me to refine my own assessment based on their reasoning.

I will choose to follow Participants 2 and 5 in the next round, as their last estimates reflect a more accurate understanding of the correlation based on the scatter plot, and they are likely to provide relevant insights moving forward. 

Now, I will submit my selection to follow these participants.
-------user--------
- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points appear to be densely clustered in certain areas, particularly in the lower to mid-range values of both axes. 
   - The distribution shows a concentration of points between X values of 0 to 80 and Y values of around 15 to 35, indicating a significant amount of data in these ranges.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is a clear upward trend in the scatter plot, indicating a positive correlation. As the X values increase, the Y values tend to increase as well.
   - The trend is not perfectly linear, as there is some spread in the data points, but the general direction is upward, suggesting a relationship between the two variables.

3. **Strength of Correlation**:
   - Given the evident upward trend, there is a strong correlation between the variables. The points are not scattered randomly; instead, they follow a general pattern that suggests that changes in one variable are associated with changes in the other.
   - The scatter plot exhibits a clear tendency, which indicates that the correlation should be relatively high.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **85**. This score reflects a strong positive correlation, indicating that there is a significant relationship between the X and Y variables.

4. **Confidence in the Result**:
   - I feel quite confident in this score being close to the actual value, as the upward trend is clear and distinctive. The density of points around this trend further supports the high correlation estimate.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 2 chose the value 40
- Participant 5 chose the value 40

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Considering the responses from Participants 2 and 5, who both chose a value of **40**, I will reassess my initial estimate of **85** based on the following points:

1. **Comparison to Other Participants**:
   - Both participants suggesting a score of 40 indicates a belief in a much weaker correlation than my initial assessment. This divergence prompts me to reconsider my own estimate.
   - Their scores imply that they perceive the correlation as much less robust, which contrasts sharply with my interpretation of the scatter plot.

2. **Re-evaluating the Scatter Plot**:
   - While my initial assessment identified a strong positive correlation based on the upward trend, it’s important to reflect on whether I may have overestimated the strength of that correlation.
   - The scores from Participants 2 and 5 suggest that they may be seeing more variability in the data points than I initially accounted for, which could indicate that the correlation is not as strong as I assessed.

3. **Confidence Level**:
   - My confidence in my original score of 85 has decreased due to the consensus from Participants 2 and 5. Their agreement on a score of 40 indicates a shared perspective that suggests the correlation is weaker than I believed.
   - Thus, it would be prudent for me to adjust my estimate downward in consideration of their insights.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - I will choose a score that reflects a compromise between my initial estimate and the lower estimates from the other participants. A score of **50** seems reasonable, as it acknowledges a positive correlation but recognizes that it may not be as strong as I initially thought.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **50**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :

- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from Participants 2 and 5, I will reassess my estimate once again based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 2 has adjusted their score to **45**, indicating a slight decrease in their assessment of correlation but still suggesting a moderate positive correlation.
   - Participant 5 has reduced their estimate to **25**, reflecting a belief in a much weaker correlation.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is still a noticeable gap between the two participants' scores. Participant 2's score of 45 suggests they still see some level of correlation, while Participant 5's score of 25 indicates a more cautious perspective.
   - This divergence signals uncertainty, and it prompts me to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of both estimates.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My last score of **50** was a compromise but may have leaned too optimistic given Participant 5's significant reduction to 25.
   - I need to balance my own observations with the adjustments made by my peers. Participant 2's score suggests that there is some correlation, while Participant 5's score indicates skepticism.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To reflect the adjustments from both participants while still accounting for the visible trend in the scatter plot, I will select a score of **35**. This score acknowledges a weak to moderate correlation, leaning slightly more towards the cautious estimates of Participant 5.

Based on this analysis, I will choose a correlation score of **35**. Now, I will submit this new value.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 30
- Participant 5 chose the new value 5 : 35

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants

- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from Participants 2 and 5, I will reassess my estimate based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 2 has adjusted their score to **30**, indicating a belief in a weak correlation.
   - Participant 5 has made a slight increase in their estimate to **35**, suggesting a view towards a weak to moderate correlation.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is a small divergence between the two participants' scores; Participant 2's score reflects a more cautious view, while Participant 5's score suggests a slightly more optimistic perspective.
   - This split indicates varying interpretations of the correlation strength and reinforces the need to carefully consider the scatter plot again.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous score of **35** was a compromise between the two participants' scores. However, given Participant 2's significant reduction to 30, it may be prudent to reassess and potentially lower my estimate further.
   - The downward adjustment from Participant 2 indicates a recognition of a weak correlation, which aligns with the overall trend of lower estimates in this round.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - Considering the consensus from Participants 2 and 5 and the downward trend in their estimates, I will select a correlation score of **28**. This score acknowledges a weak correlation while being slightly more optimistic than Participant 2's score.

Based on this analysis, I will choose a correlation score of **28**. Now, I will submit this new value.

In the previous round, my final choice was 28, which was significantly lower than the actual result of 78.0. Analyzing the responses of the participants I followed and those I did not, I will determine which participants to follow for the next round.

1. **Participants I Followed**:
   - **Participant 2 (last answer: 35)**: This participant's score indicates they perceive a weak to moderate correlation. However, it is still lower than the actual result, suggesting a cautious approach.
   - **Participant 5 (last answer: 25)**: This participant's score reflects a very weak correlation, which is far from the actual result.

2. **Participants I Did Not Follow**:
   - **Participant 1 (last answer: 25)**: Similar to Participant 5, this participant also sees a very weak correlation.
   - **Participant 3 (last answer: 25)**: Again, this participant's response aligns with a very low estimate, indicating little belief in a correlation.
   - **Participant 4 (last answer: 25)**: Like the others, this estimate reflects a consensus of low correlation.

3. **Analysis of Previous Responses**:
   - The responses from Participants 1, 3, and 4 suggest a strong consensus that the correlation is weak, with all three choosing 25. 
   - Participant 2's score of 35 is slightly higher but still underestimates the actual correlation.

4. **Choosing Participants**:
   - Given the results, I will choose to follow **Participant 2** again, as their estimate is the highest among those I followed and shows some recognition of correlation.
   - I will also choose **Participant 1**, as they represent a cautious perspective, and their consistent low estimate aligns with the recent trend.

By following Participant 2, I can get a slightly more optimistic view, while Participant 1 provides a more conservative estimate. This combination should help me navigate the next estimate more effectively.

Now, I will submit my selection to follow Participants 2 and 1.

   - Participant 2 has chosen a value of **30**, indicating a belief in a weak correlation.
   - Participant 1, on the other hand, has maintained a score of **85**, consistent with my initial assessment of a strong correlation.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is a significant divergence between the two participants' scores. Participant 2's score suggests a much weaker correlation than what I perceived in the scatter plot.
   - This discrepancy prompts me to reconsider my own estimate, especially since Participant 2 may have seen something in the data that I missed.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My initial score of **85** reflects a strong positive correlation based on the visible trend in the scatter plot. However, Participant 2's much lower estimate indicates skepticism about that correlation.
   - If I solely consider Participant 2's perspective, it suggests that I might need to adjust my estimate downward.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To find a balanced score, I will consider the responses of both participants. While I still believe a strong correlation exists, I need to account for Participant 2's viewpoint.
   - I will choose a score of **60**. This score reflects a moderate correlation, acknowledging the upward trend while also considering the caution expressed by Participant 2.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **60**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 2 has adjusted their score to **50**, indicating a belief in a moderate correlation.
   - Participant 1 has maintained their score at **85**, reflecting confidence in a strong correlation.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There remains a notable divergence between the two participants' scores. Participant 2 suggests a more cautious view of the correlation, while Participant 1 continues to assert a strong correlation.
   - This divergence again highlights the uncertainty in interpreting the scatter plot, and it prompts me to weigh both perspectives carefully.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My last score of **60** was a compromise between the two previous scores I received. However, Participant 2's adjustment to 50 indicates a further inclination towards a more moderate correlation.
   - The strong response from Participant 1 at 85 suggests that they have a solid rationale for their belief in a strong correlation.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - Given that Participant 2 has moved to 50, which is a more cautious estimate, I need to consider this while still recognizing the trend in the scatter plot.
   - To balance both viewpoints, I will choose a score of **65**. This score reflects a moderate to strong correlation, acknowledging the upward trend while also being influenced by Participant 2's more cautious estimate.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **65**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.

   - Participant 1 has maintained their score at **85**, consistently expressing confidence in a strong correlation.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is still a divergence between the two participants' scores, but the gap is narrowing. Participant 2's movement to 70 indicates they are recognizing a stronger correlation than previously thought, while Participant 1's steadfastness at 85 reinforces a strong belief in the positive relationship.
   - This suggests that there is some consensus developing towards a stronger correlation.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My last score of **65** was a compromise, but with Participant 2’s increase to 70, it indicates that I may have underestimated the correlation.
   - Participant 1’s consistent score of 85 suggests that the correlation is more robust than I initially assessed.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To reflect this new insight, I will adjust my score slightly upward. A score of **75** seems appropriate, as it acknowledges the strong positive correlation indicated by Participant 1 while also considering Participant 2's more cautious but improved estimate.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **75**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.

   - **Participant 5 (last answer: 60)**: Similar to Participant 2, this estimate reflects a cautious view of correlation.

3. **Analysis of Previous Responses**:
   - The responses from Participants 3 and 4 suggest a more accurate understanding of the correlation strength than what Participants 2 and 5 provided.
   - Participant 1’s estimate of 75 is consistent, but since it was lower than the actual result, it may indicate a need to consider perspectives from participants with higher estimates.

4. **Choosing Participants**:
   - I will choose to follow **Participant 1** again, as their consistent response of 75 aligns with my previous estimate and reflects a moderate to strong correlation.
   - I will also choose **Participant 3**, as their score of 75 aligns with Participant 1's and reflects a strong understanding of the correlation based on the data.

This combination should help me assess the next estimate more effectively while incorporating perspectives that recognize the stronger correlation.

Now, I will submit my selection to follow Participants 1 and 3.

- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are fairly densely packed, especially in the ranges of X values from 0 to 100 and Y values from 10 to 40. 
   - There is a noticeable concentration of points, indicating a significant amount of data in these ranges, particularly around the middle of the plot.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There appears to be a slight upward trend in the scatter plot, suggesting a positive correlation. As the values of X increase, the values of Y tend to increase as well.
   - However, the relationship does not appear to be strictly linear. There is some scatter around the trend, indicating variability in how Y changes with X.

3. **Strength of Correlation**:
   - The upward trend suggests a correlation exists, but the spread of the points indicates that this correlation is not very strong. 
   - The points do not follow a clear path; instead, they are somewhat scattered, which implies that while there is a tendency for Y to increase as X increases, this relationship is not very strong.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **55**. This reflects a moderate positive correlation, indicating that there is a relationship between X and Y, but it is not particularly strong.

4. **Confidence in the Result**:
   - I feel moderately confident in this score. The upward trend is visible, but the significant scatter means that the correlation is not robust. Thus, I expect this estimate to be reasonably close to the actual value.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 1 chose the value 55
- Participant 3 chose the value 70

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from Participants 1 and 3, I will reassess my estimate based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 1 has chosen a value of **55**, which is consistent with my own estimate. This indicates agreement on the moderate correlation I identified.
   - Participant 3 has chosen a value of **70**, suggesting a stronger belief in the correlation than I initially assessed.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - The difference between the two participants' estimates indicates a divergence in interpretation. While Participant 1 aligns with my assessment, Participant 3 believes the correlation is stronger.
   - This prompts me to reconsider whether I may have underestimated the strength of the correlation based on the scatter plot.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My initial score of **55** reflects a moderate correlation, but the upward trend observed could warrant a slightly higher score.
   - The increased estimate from Participant 3 suggests they see a clearer relationship in the data points than I did.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To reflect the information from both participants while still acknowledging the scatter I observed, I will choose a score of **65**. This score recognizes the upward trend and the stronger correlation suggested by Participant 3 while still being cautious.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **65**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.

   - Their consensus at 60 suggests a shared perspective that aligns with a more cautious view of the correlation.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - The agreement between Participants 1 and 3 indicates a recognition that the correlation might not be as strong as I assessed in my last estimate.
   - This change in their positions prompts me to reconsider my own score, especially since they are both moving towards a lower estimate.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous score of **65** was based on the upward trend observed, but with both participants adjusting their scores downward, it’s necessary to reflect on the data and their reasoning.
   - A score of 60 might better represent a moderate correlation without being overly optimistic.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - Considering the consensus from Participants 1 and 3, I will adjust my estimate to **60**. This score aligns with their perspectives while still recognizing that there is a positive correlation present.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **60**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.

   - Participant 3 has also increased their estimate to **65**, suggesting a recognition of a stronger correlation than I had assessed in my last submission.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - Both participants moving their scores upward indicates a consensus towards a stronger correlation than I initially perceived.
   - Their adjustments suggest that they see a clearer relationship in the data points or that they have reassessed the scatter plot to reflect a more optimistic view.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous score of **60** was cautious and reflected their earlier estimates. However, with both participants increasing their scores, it may be prudent to adjust my own estimate upward as well.
   - The upward trend in the scatter plot suggests that a moderate to strong correlation exists, and the participants' adjustments reinforce that perspective.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To reflect the insights from Participants 1 and 3, I will choose a score of **63**. This score acknowledges the upward trend and the stronger correlation while remaining slightly below Participant 3’s score to reflect some caution.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **63**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.

-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are fairly scattered across the plot and show a dense concentration around the middle range of values for both X and Y axes.
   - There are points spread from approximately -100 to 150 on the Y-axis and from -20 to 120 on the X-axis. The distribution appears to be relatively uniform without strong clustering in specific areas.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is no clear linear or non-linear trend visible in the scatter plot. The points do not seem to follow any specific direction, indicating a lack of correlation.
   - The scatter suggests randomness, as there are no visible patterns that indicate how one variable might change in relation to the other.

3. **Strength of Correlation**:
   - Given the apparent randomness of the data points, it seems that changes in one variable (X) do not correspond to predictable changes in the other variable (Y).
   - The scatter plot indicates that the correlation is very weak, as there is no discernible relationship between the two variables.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **10**. This reflects a very weak correlation, indicating that there is almost no relationship between X and Y.

4. **Confidence in the Result**:
   - I feel confident in this score being close to the actual value, as the scatter plot does not exhibit any noticeable trends or relationships that would suggest a stronger correlation.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

   - **Participant 2 (last answer: 20)**: This participant has a lower estimate, indicating they perceive a weaker correlation than I assessed. Their score reflects caution and may indicate they see the scatter plot differently.
   - **Participant 4 (last answer: 25)**: This participant’s score aligns with my estimate and suggests a belief in a weak correlation, which is consistent with my analysis.

2. **Participants I Did Not Follow**:
   - **Participant 1 (last answer: 15)**: This participant suggests a very weak correlation, which is lower than my estimate and may indicate a more cautious approach.
   - **Participant 3 (last answer: 20)**: Similar to Participant 2, this score reflects a weak correlation.
   - **Participant 5 (last answer: 22)**: This estimate is also on the lower side and suggests a recognition of weak correlation.

3. **Analysis of Previous Responses**:
   - The responses from Participants 1, 3, and 5 indicate a consensus around the belief that the correlation is weak, with all of them providing lower estimates compared to my last score and Participant 4’s estimate.
   - Participant 2's score of 20 also suggests a belief in a weaker correlation, while Participant 4's alignment with my previous score shows some consistency.

4. **Choosing Participants**:
   - I will choose to follow **Participant 4** again, as their score of 25 reflects a more cautious estimate that aligns with my previous thoughts.
   - I will also choose **Participant 5**, whose score of 22 indicates a weak correlation and is closer to the actual result, providing a perspective that may help in refining my estimate.

By following Participants 4 and 5, I will gain insights that reflect both cautious and moderately optimistic views of the correlation, which may help me adjust my estimate more effectively in the next round.

Now, I will submit my selection to follow Participants 4 and 5.

- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are relatively sparse, with only a few data points present, specifically five points.
   - There is a noticeable clustering of points around the X-axis values of 50 to 80 and Y-axis values of 20 to 30.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is a slight upward trend visible, suggesting that as the X values increase, the Y values tend to increase as well. However, this trend is not very strong due to the limited number of data points.
   - The points do not follow a perfect linear path but do suggest a weak positive relationship.

3. **Strength of Correlation**:
   - Given the upward trend, there appears to be some correlation between the variables, but the small number of points and their spread indicate that this correlation is weak.
   - The correlation does not appear to be strong or robust, primarily due to the limited dataset.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **30**. This reflects a weak positive correlation, indicating that there is some relationship between X and Y, but it is not particularly strong.

4. **Confidence in the Result**:
   - I feel moderately confident in this score. While there is an upward trend, the limited number of data points and their scattering suggest that the correlation is weak. Thus, I expect this estimate to be reasonably close to the actual value.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 4 chose the value 85
- Participant 5 chose the value 35

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from Participants 4 and 5, I will reassess my estimate based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 4 has chosen a value of **85**, indicating a strong belief in a high correlation between the variables. This is significantly higher than my estimate of 30 and suggests they perceive a clear relationship in the data.
   - Participant 5 has selected a value of **35**, which is closer to my estimate and suggests a belief in a weak correlation.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is a significant divergence between the two participants' scores. Participant 4's score suggests a very strong correlation, while Participant 5's score aligns more closely with my own assessment.
   - This disparity indicates differing interpretations of the scatter plot and prompts me to reflect on my own analysis.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My initial score of **30** reflects a weak correlation based on the limited data points and their distribution. However, Participant 4's score of 85 indicates they see a much stronger relationship, which could suggest that there are patterns in the data that I might have underestimated.
   - Participant 5's score of 35 aligns more closely with my view but is still slightly higher than my estimate.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To balance the perspectives of both participants, I will choose a score of **40**. This score acknowledges that there may be some correlation present while remaining more cautious than Participant 4's higher estimate.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **40**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 70
- Participant 5 chose the new value 5 : 40

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from Participants 4 and 5, I will reassess my estimate based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 4 has increased their score to **70**, indicating a belief in a strong correlation. This is a significant adjustment upwards and suggests they see a clearer relationship in the data than I previously assessed.
   - Participant 5 has maintained their estimate at **40**, which aligns with my previous adjustment and indicates a weak correlation.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is a notable divergence between the two participants' scores. Participant 4's score suggests a much stronger correlation, while Participant 5's score reflects a more cautious view.
   - This split indicates differing interpretations of the scatter plot and highlights the uncertainty in estimating the correlation strength.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous estimate of **40** indicates a weak correlation, but Participant 4's increase to 70 suggests recognition of a stronger relationship than I initially perceived.
   - Given the upward trend observed in the scatter plot, it may be reasonable to adjust my score upwards in light of Participant 4's perspective.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To find a balanced score, I will consider both perspectives. While I want to acknowledge Participant 4's stronger estimate, I also need to respect the more cautious view from Participant 5.
   - I will choose a score of **55**. This represents a moderate correlation while being lower than Participant 4's score, reflecting some caution.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **55**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :

Given the new responses from Participants 4 and 5, I will reassess my estimate based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Both Participant 4 and Participant 5 have now chosen a value of **55**, indicating a joint belief in a moderate correlation.
   - This consensus suggests that they both see a similar relationship in the data, which may validate my previous estimate of 55.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - The agreement between Participants 4 and 5 indicates a shared understanding of the correlation strength and reflects a more cautious view compared to Participant 4’s earlier estimate of 70.
   - Their alignment at 55 suggests that they recognize some level of correlation, but not as strong as initially thought.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous estimate of **55** aligns perfectly with both participants' latest choices. This reinforces my confidence in this estimate, as it reflects the current consensus among the participants I am following.
   - Since there is no significant divergence in the latest estimates, I feel confident maintaining my score.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - Given that all participants are in agreement at **55**, I will maintain my estimate at **55**. This reflects a moderate correlation and acknowledges the shared perspective of the data.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **55**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.

-------assistant--------
To analyze the provided scatter plot, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are densely clustered along a narrow vertical band around the X-axis value of approximately 0.5, with very little spread horizontally.
   - The Y-values range from about 0.02 to 0.08, indicating that most points are concentrated in a small vertical space.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is a slight vertical alignment of points, but there is no clear linear or non-linear trend indicating a relationship between X and Y values.
   - The scattering indicates that the Y values remain relatively constant regardless of the changes in X, suggesting no correlation.

3. **Strength of Correlation**:
   - Given the distribution of the points, it appears that changes in X do not correspond to changes in Y. The points are scattered without a discernible pattern, indicating a lack of correlation.
   - Therefore, the correlation is very weak, as the data does not demonstrate any meaningful relationship.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **5**. This reflects a very weak correlation, indicating that there is almost no relationship between X and Y.

4. **Confidence in the Result**:
   - I feel confident in this score being close to the actual value, as the scatter plot does not exhibit any noticeable trends or relationships that would suggest a stronger correlation.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

-------assistant--------
To analyze the provided scatter plot, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are densely clustered in a parabolic shape, particularly around the mid-range of X values (from approximately 0.5 to 1.5).
   - There are many points that are close together, indicating a high density in this region, while points at the extremes (around 0 and 2) are fewer.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - The data points form a clear upward curve, peaking around X = 1.2 and then decreasing as X increases beyond that point. This indicates a non-linear relationship.
   - The shape suggests that as X increases to a certain point, Y increases, but after reaching the peak, the relationship reverses, leading to a decrease in Y.

3. **Strength of Correlation**:
   - Given the clear parabolic trend, there is a strong correlation between the variables, but it is non-linear. The relationship can be described as quadratic.
   - The points follow a specific pattern, indicating that changes in one variable (X) have a predictable effect on the other variable (Y), at least within the central range.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **85**. This reflects a strong correlation, indicating that there is a significant relationship between X and Y, though it is not linear.

4. **Confidence in the Result**:
   - I feel confident in this score being close to the actual value, as the clear parabolic trend is very distinctive. The density of points around this trend further supports a strong correlation estimate.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

   - Both Participant 4 and Participant 5 have chosen a value of **5**, indicating they perceive a very weak correlation. This is drastically lower than my initial estimate of 85 and suggests they see almost no relationship in the data.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is a significant divergence between my estimate and the estimates from both participants. Their scores imply that they believe the correlation is almost nonexistent, which contrasts sharply with my assessment of a strong parabolic relationship.
   - This disparity prompts me to reconsider my own interpretation of the scatter plot, as it highlights differing perspectives on the strength of the correlation.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My initial score of **85** was based on the clear upward trend I observed in the scatter plot. However, the low scores from Participants 4 and 5 suggest that they may have a valid point regarding the interpretation of the data.
   - It's possible that I overestimated the correlation strength or that the non-linear relationship is being interpreted differently by others.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To find a balanced score, I will consider both perspectives. Participant 4 and Participant 5’s low estimates indicate they see the relationship as weak, but I still maintain that there is some correlation present due to the clear parabolic trend.
   - I will choose a score of **25**. This score acknowledges a very weak correlation while being significantly lower than my previous estimate, reflecting the caution expressed by Participants 4 and 5.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **25**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.

   - This is significantly lower than my last estimate of 25, suggesting that they see little to no relationship in the data.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is a significant divergence between my estimate of 25 and the estimates from both participants. Their low scores suggest that they do not see any meaningful correlation, contrasting sharply with my previous assessment of a strong parabolic trend.
   - Their consensus at 5 reinforces the idea that there may be a misinterpretation of the data on my part.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous score of 25 reflected a belief in a weak correlation based on the parabolic trend I observed. However, the strong agreement between Participants 4 and 5 at 5 indicates they see the relationship as negligible.
   - It is crucial to consider that they may have valid reasons for their assessment, which warrants a reassessment on my part.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - Given that both participants are in agreement at 5, it would be prudent to adjust my score downward significantly.
   - I will select a correlation score of **10**. This reflects a very weak correlation while still acknowledging that there may be a slight relationship present, recognizing the caution expressed by both participants.

   - There is a significant divergence between my estimate (10) and the estimates from both participants (5). Their scores imply that they do not see any meaningful correlation, which contrasts with my previous assessment of a very weak correlation.
   - Their strong agreement reinforces the idea that I may be misinterpreting the data.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous score of **10** reflected a belief in a very weak correlation based on the scatter plot. However, Participant 4 and Participant 5's strong agreement at 5 indicates they perceive the relationship as negligible.
   - It’s essential to consider that their perspective may be valid, prompting me to reassess my own interpretation of the scatter plot.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - Given that both participants are consistent with their score of 5, I should adjust my estimate downward to reflect this consensus.
   - I will select a correlation score of **5**. This acknowledges the very weak correlation they perceive and aligns with their cautious view of the data.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **5**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.

-------assistant--------
In the previous round, my final choice was 5, which was very close to the actual result of 3.0. Analyzing the responses from the participants I followed and those I did not, I will determine which participants to follow for the next round.

1. **Participants I Followed**:
   - **Participant 4 (last answer: 5)**: This participant's score aligns perfectly with mine, indicating a shared understanding of the correlation strength.
   - **Participant 5 (last answer: 5)**: This participant also has the same score, reinforcing the view of a very weak correlation.

2. **Participants I Did Not Follow**:
   - **Participant 1 (last answer: 5)**: This participant's score matches mine and indicates a belief in a very weak correlation.
   - **Participant 2 (last answer: 5)**: Similar to Participants 4 and 5, this score reflects a consensus on a very weak correlation.
   - **Participant 3 (last answer: 8)**: This estimate is slightly higher than the others, suggesting a belief in a slightly stronger correlation, but still low.

3. **Analysis of Previous Responses**:
   - There is a strong consensus among Participants 1, 2, 4, and 5 that the correlation is very weak, all choosing a score of 5, which aligns well with my assessment.
   - Participant 3’s score of 8 indicates a slightly more optimistic view of the correlation, which may be worth considering.

4. **Choosing Participants**:
   - I will choose to follow **Participant 1**, as their score of 5 reflects a consistent view that aligns with my previous thoughts.
   - I will also choose **Participant 3**, whose score of 8 represents a slightly more optimistic view of the correlation. This could help provide a broader perspective on the strength of the correlation in the next estimate.

By following Participants 1 and 3, I will gain insights that reflect both cautious and slightly optimistic views of the correlation, which may help me adjust my estimate more effectively in the next round.

Now, I will submit my selection to follow Participants 1 and 3.

- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are scattered across the plot, with a noticeable concentration in the mid-range of both X (around 40 to 100) and Y values (around 0 to 50).
   - The distribution shows a few points clustered closely together, while others are more isolated, indicating some variability.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is a visible upward trend in the scatter plot, suggesting a positive correlation. As the X values increase, the Y values also tend to increase, although the relationship is not very strong due to some spread.
   - The trend appears somewhat linear, with points generally following an upward trajectory as X increases.

3. **Strength of Correlation**:
   - Given the upward trend, there appears to be a moderate correlation between the variables. However, the spread of points away from this trend indicates that the correlation is not very strong.
   - Overall, while there seems to be a relationship, it is not robust enough to indicate high correlation.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **60**. This reflects a moderate positive correlation, indicating that there is a relationship between X and Y, but it is not particularly strong.

4. **Confidence in the Result**:
   - I feel moderately confident in this score. The upward trend is clear, but the variability suggests that the correlation is not as strong as it could be. Thus, I expect this estimate to be reasonably close to the actual value.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 1 chose the value 5
- Participant 3 chose the value 30

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from Participants 1 and 3, I will reassess my estimate based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 1 has chosen a value of **5**, indicating they perceive a very weak correlation. This is significantly lower than my initial estimate of 60 and suggests they see almost no relationship in the data.
   - Participant 3 has chosen a value of **30**, indicating a belief in a weak correlation, which is still lower than my estimate but shows some recognition of a relationship.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is a significant divergence between my estimate of 60 and the estimates from both participants. Participant 1's score suggests that they believe there is virtually no correlation, while Participant 3 acknowledges a weak correlation.
   - This disparity prompts me to reconsider my own interpretation of the scatter plot, as it highlights differing perspectives on the strength of the correlation.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My initial score of **60** reflected a moderate correlation based on the upward trend I observed. However, Participant 1's score of 5 indicates they see a much weaker relationship, while Participant 3's score of 30 suggests they perceive some correlation but not as strong as I initially assessed.
   - It’s important to consider that both participants may have valid interpretations of the data that warrant a reassessment of my own estimate.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To find a balanced score, I will consider both perspectives. Participant 1's score suggests a very weak correlation, while Participant 3's score indicates a weak correlation that is more in line with my thoughts.
   - I will choose a score of **25**. This score acknowledges that there may be a weak correlation present while being significantly lower than my previous estimate of 60.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **25**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 1 chose the new value 1 : 30
- Participant 3 chose the new value 3 : 25

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from Participants 1 and 3, I will reassess my estimate based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 1 has adjusted their score to **30**, indicating a belief in a weak correlation, which is an increase from their previous estimate.
   - Participant 3 has slightly lowered their estimate to **25**, suggesting they still believe in a weak correlation but are cautious.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is still a divergence between the two participants' scores. Participant 1's score of 30 suggests a slightly stronger belief in correlation than Participant 3’s score of 25.
   - This divergence prompts me to reconsider my own estimate, especially since both participants are adjusting their scores based on previous discussions.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous score of **25** reflected a belief in a weak correlation, which aligns with Participant 3's current estimate. However, Participant 1's score of 30 indicates they see a stronger relationship.
   - It’s important to consider that Participant 1 may have identified some aspects of the data that I underestimated.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To find a balanced score, I will consider both perspectives. Participant 1’s score suggests a recognition of a weak correlation, while Participant 3’s score reflects a more cautious view.
   - I will choose a score of **28**. This score acknowledges a weak correlation while being slightly higher than Participant 3’s estimate, reflecting the perspective of Participant 1 as well.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **28**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 1 chose the new value 1 : 25
- Participant 3 chose the new value 3 : 27

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new responses from Participants 1 and 3, I will reassess my estimate based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Participant Responses**:
   - Participant 1 has adjusted their score to **25**, indicating they perceive a very weak correlation, which is consistent with their previous cautious stance.
   - Participant 3 has slightly increased their estimate to **27**, suggesting a belief in a weak correlation but still reflecting caution.

2. **Assessing the Divergence**:
   - There is a minor divergence between the two participants' scores. Participant 1's score of 25 suggests a very weak correlation, while Participant 3's score of 27 indicates a slightly stronger belief in the correlation.
   - This difference highlights a subtle shift in perspective and prompts me to reconsider my own estimate.

3. **Re-evaluating My Position**:
   - My previous score of **28** was based on the belief in a weak correlation. With Participant 1's score of 25, I see the consensus leaning toward a very weak correlation, while Participant 3's score indicates a recognition of some relationship.
   - Given this, it may be prudent to adjust my estimate downward to align more closely with Participant 1’s viewpoint.

4. **Finding a New Estimate**:
   - To reflect the adjustments from both participants, I will choose a score of **26**. This score acknowledges the very weak correlation while being slightly more optimistic than Participant 1's estimate.

Based on this analysis, I will select a correlation score of **26**. Now, I will submit this adjusted value.
-------user--------
This round(10), your final choice was the value 26. The exact result was 8.0
