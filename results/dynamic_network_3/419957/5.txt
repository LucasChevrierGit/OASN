Context :
- You are participating in an economic experiment. 
- You are an average human and should mimick its guessing capabilities
- Your task is to analyze an image and estimate what is called a correlation coefficient. 
- Points will be scattered all arround the image
- A straight line will mean 100% correlation between points, points scattered everywhere 0%
- You will potentially have the possibility to see other participants responses and revise your answer
-------user--------
- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let's go through the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The majority of points are clustered in a specific range around the x-axis, primarily between -1 and 1 for the x-values. 
   - There are a few outliers on the higher end of the x-axis (around 4), which seem to fall below the general trend of the other points.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - Observing the scatter plot, it appears that there is a non-linear relationship, possibly a quadratic one. 
   - As the x-values increase from negative to positive, the y-values increase and then appear to plateau or slightly decrease at higher x-values.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - A linear relationship would yield a higher correlation score, but since the points do not form a straight line, the correlation is not perfect.
   - The points are well organized in a curve, indicating some form of correlation, but the presence of outliers suggests that the correlation isn’t extremely strong.

4. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - Since the majority of points follow a clear trend, I'll rate the correlation as moderately strong but not perfect due to the non-linear pattern and outliers.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of 65. 

### Confidence Level
I feel moderately confident in this score being close to the actual value, as the scatter plot shows a clear trend but also contains non-linear characteristics and outliers, which complicate the relationship.
-------user--------
You must provide a value based on your previous message answer. Next time, please provide a value using the tool along with your message.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 4 chose the value 10
- Participant 3 chose the value 0

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the first responses from participants 4 and 3, I need to reassess my initial estimate of 65 based on their values of 10 and 0.

1. **Assessing Other Participants' Estimates**:
   - Participant 4's estimate of 10 suggests they see almost no correlation in the scatter plot. This indicates they perceive a very weak relationship between the variables.
   - Participant 3’s estimate of 0 indicates they see no correlation at all, meaning they believe the points are completely random.

2. **Reflection on the Scatter Plot**:
   - My original estimate of 65 was based on the observation of a non-linear trend in the scatter plot. However, the significantly lower values presented by the other participants suggest that they see a much weaker correlation.
   - Since I initially rated the correlation as moderately strong, I must consider if my assessment was too optimistic. The presence of outliers and the non-linear pattern might indeed lead to a lower correlation score.

3. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Considering the inputs from the other participants and reflecting on my confidence level, I believe a more conservative estimate is warranted.
   - I will adjust my score downwards, but I still feel that there is some degree of correlation present. Therefore, I will select a score of 30. This reflects a weak to moderate correlation, acknowledging the viewpoints of the other participants while still recognizing a trend in the data.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 30.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 30
- Participant 3 chose the new value 3 : 3

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the new estimates from participants 4 and 3, my thought process for reassessing my correlation score is as follows:

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Participant 4 updated their score to 30, indicating that they still see some correlation, albeit very weak.
   - Participant 3 has further reduced their score to 3, suggesting they see almost no correlation, reflecting a very pessimistic view of the relationship between the variables.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My previous score of 30 suggests a weak correlation, but seeing that both participants have opted for scores that are significantly lower indicates a consensus toward a weaker correlation.
   - The stark contrast between my score and that of Participant 3 highlights the need to consider the possibility that my initial observations may have been too optimistic.

3. **Considering the Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot still shows some structure, but the presence of outliers and the non-linear characteristics may justify a score closer to what Participant 3 has chosen.
   - Taking into account the collective input, it would be prudent to lower my estimate further, while still acknowledging that some correlation exists.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - I will adjust my score to 10. This indicates that I recognize a very weak correlation, aligning more closely with the views of the other participants while acknowledging that there is still some degree of relationship between the variables.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 10.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 20
- Participant 3 chose the new value 3 : 15

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the latest estimates from participants 4 and 3, my thought process for reassessing my correlation score is as follows:

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Participant 4 has updated their score to 20, suggesting they see a very weak correlation, which is a slight increase from their previous estimate.
   - Participant 3 has shifted their score to 15, indicating that they perceive a minimal correlation, but still more than their last estimate.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 10, which aligned with the idea of a very weak correlation. However, both participants have chosen values that reflect a marginally stronger belief in some correlation.
   - The changes in their scores suggest that there is a consensus towards recognizing some weak correlation, albeit still very low.

3. **Considering the Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot still demonstrates that while there is some relationship between the variables, it is weak, with a significant presence of outliers and a non-linear arrangement of points.
   - Given that both participants have opted for values slightly higher than what I chose, I might consider adjusting my score upwards, but still reflect the overall weak correlation.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - I will adjust my score to 15. This indicates that I acknowledge a very weak correlation that is slightly stronger than my previous estimate, which aligns well with the updated values of the other participants.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 15.
-------user--------
This round(1), your final choice was the value 15. The exact result was 9.0
/n
Here are the last answers of the participants you followed this round:
- Participant 4 last answer was 30
- Participant 3 last answer was 25

Here are the answers of the participants you did not follow this round:
- Participant 0 last answer was 20
- Participant 1 last answer was 20
- Participant 2 last answer was 12

For the next round, you can choose which participants' guessed values you want to follow.
- Carefully analyze the previous round's results.
- Identify participants whose guesses are most relevant to your strategy.
- Explain why you are choosing each participant.
- You can choose up to 2 participants.

-------assistant--------
In analyzing the previous round's results, I need to select the participants whose guesses will provide the most relevant feedback for my next estimate. Here are my considerations:

1. **Participant 4 (last answer: 30)**:
   - Participant 4 had a score of 30, which was significantly higher than my final choice of 15 and reflects a belief in a weak correlation. They may provide insights into a slightly more optimistic view of the correlation that I might have underestimated.
   - Their prior estimates show that they are willing to adjust based on the responses of others, which indicates an ability to reflect on the collective input.

2. **Participant 2 (last answer: 12)**:
   - Participant 2's last estimate of 12 is closer to the actual result of 9.0, indicating that their judgment may be more accurate in this context.
   - Since their score is lower than others and closer to the actual value, they may provide a more cautious perspective that aligns well with the trend of low correlation.

### Selection Summary:
- I will choose **Participant 4** for their more optimistic estimate that might capture a potential upward trend in correlation.
- I will also choose **Participant 2** to gain insights from their lower estimate that is still reflective of a minimal correlation, providing a balanced view.

Now, I will select these participants to follow in the next round.

- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let's break down the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are densely clustered around the range of x-values between 0.44 and 0.60.
   - Most points seem to be concentrated in the lower part of the y-range (between approximately 0.02 and 0.06), with a gradual increase in the y-values as x-values increase.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - The scatter plot exhibits a non-linear trend. The points appear to follow a curve that initially rises and then starts to flatten out as x increases.
   - This suggests that the relationship between x and y is not linear, indicating a potential quadratic or polynomial relationship.

3. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - There is a clear trend, but it is not perfectly linear. The points do not form a tight band around a line, indicating that while there is some correlation, it is not strong.
   - The general shape suggests a moderate correlation, but the flattening of the curve at higher x-values indicates that the increase in y is slowing down as x increases.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **40**. This indicates a weak to moderate correlation, acknowledging the trend without overstating the strength of the relationship.

### Confidence Level
I feel moderately confident in this correlation score being close to the actual value. The clear curve suggests a relationship, but the non-linear nature and gradual flattening imply that a perfect correlation is unlikely.

Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 2 chose the value 40
- Participant 4 chose the value 5

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the estimates from participants 2 and 4, I need to reconsider my correlation score based on their inputs.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Estimates**:
   - Participant 2 chose a score of 40, which aligns perfectly with my own estimate. This indicates that we are on the same page regarding the observed trend in the scatter plot.
   - Participant 4’s score of 5 suggests they see a very weak correlation, which is significantly lower than both my estimate and Participant 2’s. This indicates that they perceive the relationship to be almost non-existent.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My score of 40 was based on the observation of a non-linear trend in the data. Since Participant 2 corroborates this, I feel confident in maintaining a similar perspective.
   - However, Participant 4’s drastically lower score indicates a different viewpoint that cannot be ignored. It suggests that there might be a valid reason to consider a weaker correlation than I initially assessed.

3. **Considering the Visual Evidence**:
   - While I still see a trend, the presence of Participant 4’s low score indicates that there might be more randomness in the data than I initially perceived.
   - Therefore, I need to balance my confidence in the trend with the possibility that the correlation may be weaker than I first thought.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Given the input from Participant 4, I will adjust my score downwards but not to the extreme level of 5. 
   - I will select a score of 25. This reflects a weaker correlation than my original estimate while not dismissing the trend entirely.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 25.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :

- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the updated estimates from participants 2 and 4, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their new values.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Participant 2 has adjusted their score to 45, indicating a belief that there is a moderate correlation between the variables. This reinforces the trend I initially observed.
   - Participant 4’s new score of 15 suggests they still perceive a very weak correlation, but it is an increase from their previous estimate of 5, indicating a slight recognition of some relationship.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 25, reflecting a weak correlation. Participant 2’s score of 45 is higher and suggests I may not have fully captured the strength of the trend in the scatter plot.
   - However, I must also consider Participant 4’s more cautious approach, which indicates that there is still significant uncertainty regarding the strength of the correlation.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot still shows a non-linear trend that suggests there is some correlation, but the points are also spread out, indicating that the correlation may not be as strong as it could be.
   - The divergence in estimates between participants highlights the need to balance the observations with a cautious approach.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - I will adjust my score upward to reflect the input from Participant 2 while still considering the cautious approach of Participant 4. 
   - I will choose a score of 35, which indicates a weak to moderate correlation, acknowledging the trend while still being mindful of the uncertainties present in the data.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 35.

Given the latest estimates from participants 2 and 4, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their new values.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Participant 2 has adjusted their score to 30, indicating a belief in a weak to moderate correlation. This suggests they still see some trend, but it is less strong than their previous estimate.
   - Participant 4's new score of 20 suggests a very weak correlation, acknowledging some relationship, but still indicating skepticism about its strength.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 35, which was an attempt to balance the inputs from both participants. However, the downward revisions from both participants indicate that I might have overestimated the correlation.
   - With Participant 2's lower estimate of 30 and Participant 4's estimate of 20, it seems prudent for me to adjust my score downward as well.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot indicates a trend, but the spread and presence of outliers suggest that the correlation is not robust.
   - It's clear that there is a relationship, but it may not be as strong as I previously thought.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - I will adjust my score downward to reflect the inputs from both participants. Taking into account the latest estimates, I will select a score of 25. This reflects a weak correlation, slightly stronger than Participant 4’s estimate but acknowledging the weaker trend suggested by the overall data.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 25.

-------assistant--------
In analyzing the previous round's results, I will choose participants to follow based on their estimates and how they relate to the actual result.

1. **Participant 2 (last answer: 35)**:
   - Participant 2’s estimate of 35 was closer to my previous guess of 25, but it still turned out to be lower than the actual result of 78. This indicates that they might have been more optimistic about the correlation initially but adjusted downwards based on the information available.
   - I will follow Participant 2 again to see if they maintain a more optimistic view in the next round, as their earlier estimate suggests they may see some aspects of correlation that I might have missed.

2. **Participant 0 (last answer: 28)**:
   - Participant 0's last estimate of 28 is relatively close to my last estimate of 25, and it is also below the actual result of 78. This suggests they share a similar cautious approach to estimating correlation.
   - Following Participant 0 may provide me with insights that align with a more moderate view. Their estimates could help me adjust my strategy to better gauge the correlation based on collective insights.

### Selection Summary:
- I will choose **Participant 2** for their slightly more optimistic perspective that aligns with recognizing potential trends.
- I will also choose **Participant 0** to gain insights from their estimates that are aligned with caution but still provide a different angle.

Now, I will select these participants to follow in the next round.

-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let’s break down the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are clustered in two groups: five points are located in the lower range of x-values (0 to 20) and y-values (18 to 24), while three points are in a higher range (around 65 to 80 for x and 28 to 32 for y).
   - The distribution shows that most points tend to fall in the lower left region, with a couple of higher points indicating a potential trend towards increasing values.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There appears to be a relationship where, as the x-values increase, the y-values increase as well. This suggests a potential positive correlation.
   - However, due to the sparse nature of the data points and the distinct separation between the lower and upper groups, the relationship may not be strong.

3. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - The correlation seems to be moderate at best. While there is an observable trend where higher x-values correspond to higher y-values, the data points are not tightly clustered around a line. 
   - The three higher points could be seen as outliers, which indicates that while there is some correlation, it may not be robust.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **50**. This reflects a moderate correlation, recognizing the trend while also considering the spread and separation of the points.

### Confidence Level
I feel moderately confident in this score being close to the actual value. The trend is noticeable, but the gaps between the groups of points imply that the correlation is not very strong, leaving room for uncertainty.

-------assistant--------
Given the estimates from participants 0 and 2, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their inputs.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Estimates**:
   - Participant 0’s estimate of 85 suggests they see a very strong correlation. This is significantly higher than my estimate of 50 and indicates a belief in a clear and consistent relationship between the variables.
   - Participant 2’s estimate of 30 suggests they see a weak correlation, which aligns more closely with my initial assessment but is still lower than my score.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My score of 50 was based on the observation of a moderate trend in the scatter plot. Participant 2’s estimate reinforces my view that the correlation is not particularly strong.
   - However, Participant 0's drastically higher estimate indicates a different perspective, suggesting they perceive a much clearer trend than I observed.

3. **Considering the Visual Evidence**:
   - While there is a trend where higher x-values correspond to higher y-values, the presence of distinct groups of points and the lack of tight clustering around a line suggest that the correlation might not be as strong as Participant 0 believes.
   - The divergence in estimates highlights the need to balance optimism with cautiousness.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Given the contrasting views, I will adjust my score downward to reflect a more cautious stance while still acknowledging the trend. 
   - I will select a score of 40, which reflects a moderate correlation but leans towards the lower end based on the input from Participant 2.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 40.

   - Participant 2’s estimate remains at 50, indicating they still see a moderate correlation, which aligns well with their previous perspective and is consistent with my own observations.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 40, which was a downward adjustment reflecting a cautious approach. The new scores indicate that both participants are leaning towards a stronger correlation than I initially assessed.
   - The fact that Participant 0’s estimate has dropped from 85 to 60 suggests they may have recognized some of the weaknesses in the correlation, while Participant 2’s steadiness at 50 indicates a stable view of the correlation strength.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot does show some degree of correlation, though it is not particularly strong or linear. The presence of distinct groupings of points suggests that while there is some relationship, it may not be as robust as a score of 60 would imply.
   - I need to balance the insights from both participants while considering the reality of the scatter plot.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - I will adjust my score to 50. This reflects a moderate correlation that aligns with Participant 2’s consistent estimate and acknowledges Participant 0’s more cautious adjustment.
   - This score recognizes the trend without overstating the strength of the correlation.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 50.

   - Participant 2’s estimate has risen to 70, which reflects an even stronger belief in the correlation between the variables. This indicates that they perceive a significant relationship that I may not have fully captured.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 50, which reflected a moderate correlation. However, both participants are now indicating a stronger correlation with their revised estimates, suggesting that I may need to adjust my perspective.
   - The upward adjustments from both participants indicate a consensus towards recognizing a more robust correlation than I initially assessed.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot still shows a trend where higher x-values correspond to higher y-values, but the presence of distinct groupings of points and the lack of tight clustering suggest that while there is correlation, it may not be as strong as Participant 0 and Participant 2 believe.
   - Nevertheless, their confidence in a higher correlation indicates I should reconsider my assessment.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - I will adjust my score to 60. This reflects a moderate to strong correlation, which is more in line with the views of both participants. It acknowledges the trend while maintaining a level of caution due to the spread of the points.

- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let’s break down the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are densely clustered vertically at a very narrow range of x-values, primarily around 0.5, while the y-values are tightly packed between approximately 0.01 and 0.06.
   - This indicates that there is very little variation in the x-values, which suggests that any potential correlation might be weak.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - The distribution of points suggests a possible vertical alignment with minimal spread. This indicates that as x-values change, the y-values do not show significant variation.
   - There is no visible trend since the points are very close to each other on the y-axis, suggesting randomness rather than any discernible relationship.

3. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - Since the x-values are clustered and do not significantly change while y-values remain tightly grouped, it indicates a lack of correlation between the two variables.
   - The correlation appears to be very weak, if not nonexistent, because there is no observable change in y-values with respect to changes in x-values.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **5**. This reflects a very weak correlation, essentially indicating that there is almost no relationship between the variables.

### Confidence Level
I feel very confident in this score being close to the actual value. The tight clustering of points with minimal variation suggests that any correlation is negligible, supporting the low score assigned.

You must provide a value based on your previous message answer. Next time, please provide a value using the tool along with your message.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 0 chose the value 55
- Participant 1 chose the value 55

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the estimates from participants 0 and 1, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their inputs.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Estimates**:
   - Both Participant 0 and Participant 1 have chosen a score of 55, indicating they perceive a moderate correlation between the variables. This is significantly higher than my estimate of 5, suggesting they see a relationship where I do not.
   - Their identical estimates suggest a shared perspective on the correlation, which might reflect a more optimistic view of the data than what I observed.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My score of 5 was based on the observation of clustered points with minimal variation, indicating a very weak correlation. However, the consensus among both participants suggests that they see a potential trend that I may have missed.
   - The difference in our estimates indicates a significant divergence in interpreting the scatter plot, and I need to consider whether my analysis may have been overly cautious.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - While I still see the tight clustering of points, the fact that both participants perceive a moderate correlation indicates that there may be nuances in the data that I did not fully account for.
   - Their consistent estimates suggest they recognize a relationship that might not be evident at first glance, thus indicating a need for a slight adjustment in my assessment.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Although I still believe the correlation is weak, I will adjust my score upward to reflect the perspectives of Participants 0 and 1. 
   - I will select a score of 25. This acknowledges a weak correlation but recognizes that there may be more of a relationship than I initially assessed.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 25.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 65
- Participant 1 chose the new value 1 : 60

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the latest estimates from participants 0 and 1, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their new values.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Participant 0 has revised their estimate to 65, which suggests they believe there is a strong correlation between the variables. This is a significant increase from their previous score of 55.
   - Participant 1 has adjusted their estimate to 60, indicating they also perceive a moderate to strong correlation, though slightly less than Participant 0.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 25, which reflects a weak correlation based on the tight clustering of points and minimal variation in y-values. The new scores from both participants indicate a much stronger belief in a relationship between the variables than I initially assessed.
   - The divergence between my estimate and those of the participants suggests I may need to significantly adjust my perspective.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The tight clustering of points still suggests limited variation, which raises questions about the strength of the correlation. However, the strong estimates from both participants indicate that they see a trend that I may not have fully accounted for in my analysis.
   - Their confidence in a stronger correlation suggests that I should reconsider the data and potentially acknowledge a relationship that is more pronounced than my initial assessment.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - While I still see a tight clustering of points, I will adjust my score upward to reflect the inputs from Participants 0 and 1. 
   - I will select a score of 45. This acknowledges that there may be more correlation than I initially perceived while still remaining cautious about the strength of that correlation.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 45.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 60
- Participant 1 chose the new value 1 : 62

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the updated estimates from participants 0 and 1, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their new values.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Participant 0 has revised their estimate to 60, indicating they see a strong correlation. This reflects a belief that there is a notable relationship between the variables.
   - Participant 1 has adjusted their estimate to 62, suggesting they also perceive a significant correlation, slightly higher than Participant 0’s score. This indicates a consensus among both participants that the correlation is stronger than I previously assessed.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 45, which reflected a moderate correlation. However, the new estimates from both participants suggest a stronger belief in the correlation than what I had. This highlights a significant divergence in our interpretations of the scatter plot.
   - The steady upward revisions by both participants point to their perception of a trend that I may not have fully accounted for in my analysis.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - While I still observe that the points are somewhat clustered, there is a suggestion of a trend that both participants are identifying more strongly. Their confidence in a higher correlation suggests that there is merit in reconsidering my assessment.
   - The increasing scores imply that the participants are recognizing a relationship that is becoming clearer with each round of analysis.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - I will adjust my score upward to better align with the views of Participants 0 and 1 while maintaining a level of caution based on my earlier observations.
   - I will select a score of 55. This reflects a recognition of the moderate to strong correlation they perceive while still being mindful of the inherent uncertainty in the data.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 55.
-------user--------

- You can choose up to 2 participants.

-------assistant--------
In analyzing the previous round's results, I will select participants to follow based on their estimates and their relation to the actual result.

1. **Participant 0 (last answer: 63)**:
   - Participant 0's estimate of 63 is notably higher than my last estimate of 55 and closer to the actual result of 47. This suggests they see a stronger correlation than I assessed, which may indicate they have a better understanding of the relationship in the scatter plot.
   - Following Participant 0 may provide insights that align with a more optimistic view regarding the correlation.

2. **Participant 2 (last answer: 50)**:
   - Participant 2's estimate of 50 is more conservative and very close to the actual result of 47. This indicates they may have a more accurate perspective on the correlation strength.
   - Following Participant 2 could provide a balanced viewpoint that recognizes the correlation without overstating it, which is valuable in refining my own estimate.

### Selection Summary:
- I will choose **Participant 0** for their higher estimate that may reflect a stronger trend.
- I will also choose **Participant 2** to gain insights from their more cautious and potentially accurate perspective.

Now, I will select these participants to follow in the next round.

  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.

- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let’s break down the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are scattered in a non-linear fashion, with a noticeable cluster of points at lower x-values (around 0 to 60) and a few higher x-values (around 80 to 100).
   - The distribution shows that there is a concentration of points in the lower left quadrant, while points in the upper right quadrant have higher y-values but are more sparse.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There appears to be a non-linear trend evident from the scatter plot. The points seem to form a curved shape rather than a straight line, suggesting a possible quadratic or polynomial relationship.
   - As x-values increase from low to high, the y-values initially increase to a peak and then may begin to decline, indicating a potential maximum point.

3. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - The relationship between the variables is not strong, as the points do not tightly follow a line or curve. The spread of points, especially in the lower x-values, suggests variability in y-values that does not correlate well with x.
   - Overall, there is a visible relationship, but it is not robust, suggesting a moderate correlation.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **40**. This indicates a moderate correlation, recognizing the trend while also considering the spread and lack of tight clustering.

### Confidence Level
I feel moderately confident in this score being close to the actual value. The trend is noticeable, but the non-linear nature and the spread of points indicate that the correlation is not very strong, leaving room for uncertainty.

Given the estimates from participants 0 and 2, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their inputs.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Estimates**:
   - Participant 0 has chosen a score of 10, indicating they perceive a very weak correlation. This is significantly lower than my estimate of 40 and suggests they see a lack of relationship between the variables.
   - Participant 2's estimate of 60 indicates they see a moderate to strong correlation, which is higher than my score and suggests a belief in a more pronounced relationship between the variables.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My score of 40 was based on observing a non-linear trend in the scatter plot. Participant 2’s estimate aligns with my view that there is some correlation, while Participant 0’s score suggests a very different perspective.
   - The divergence between my estimate and those of the participants highlights the need to consider whether my analysis might have been too optimistic.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot does show a trend, but Participant 0’s low estimate indicates that they might be seeing random patterns rather than a clear relationship. On the other hand, Participant 2’s higher estimate suggests they are recognizing a trend that I also observed, albeit with more confidence.
   - The contrast between participants indicates that there is uncertainty in evaluating the correlation strength.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Given the input from Participant 2, I will adjust my score upwards but not as high as 60. I will select a score of 35. This reflects a weak to moderate correlation, acknowledging the trend while being cautious based on Participant 0’s perspective.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 35.

Given the updated estimates from participants 0 and 2, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their new values.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Participant 0 has revised their score to 30, suggesting they see a weak correlation, which is an increase from their initial estimate of 10 but still reflects skepticism about the relationship.
   - Participant 2 has adjusted their estimate to 50, indicating they perceive a moderate correlation, which is higher than my previous estimate and suggests a stronger belief in the relationship between the variables.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 35, which was a compromise between the views of both participants. However, Participant 2's increase to 50 indicates a stronger belief in the correlation than I assessed, while Participant 0's score suggests they remain cautious.
   - The divergence between my estimate and those of the participants suggests that I may need to adjust my score to better reflect the collective input.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot still shows a trend, but the presence of Participant 0's lower estimate indicates there may be randomness that I did not fully account for. However, Participant 2's higher estimate suggests they recognize a valid trend.
   - The scores indicate a need for a balanced approach between recognizing potential correlation and being cautious of overestimating it.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - I will adjust my score upward to reflect Participant 2’s perspective while also considering Participant 0's more cautious view. 
   - I will select a score of 40. This reflects a moderate correlation that acknowledges the trend while remaining grounded in the skepticism expressed by Participant 0.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 40.

-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let’s break down the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are scattered with a noticeable concentration towards the lower x-values (0 to 40) and a more spread-out distribution towards the higher x-values (60 to 100).
   - There are fewer points in the lower range, but as x-values increase, especially in the range from 80 to 100, the y-values also show an increase, indicating a possible trend.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is a visible upward trend where higher x-values correspond to higher y-values. This suggests a positive correlation between the two variables.
   - The points appear to follow a non-linear trend, although the overall pattern suggests a potential linear relationship.

3. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - The correlation seems to be moderate. While there is a noticeable relationship, the points are not tightly clustered around a line, indicating variability. The presence of points that are further apart at the higher x-values suggests that while there is some correlation, it may not be very strong.
   - Overall, the relationship seems present, but the spread of the points indicates that the correlation is not robust.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **55**. This reflects a moderate correlation, acknowledging the trend while considering the spread of the points.

### Confidence Level
I feel moderately confident in this score being close to the actual value. The upward trend is clear, but the variability in the spread of the points leaves room for uncertainty in the strength of the correlation.

- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let’s break down the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are scattered across the x and y axes, with a noticeable concentration in the lower left quadrant (x-values from 0 to around 40 and y-values around 15 to 25).
   - The points are more spread out in the higher x-values (above 60), where y-values range between 25 and 35.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There appears to be a slight upward trend in the scatter plot. As x-values increase, y-values also tend to increase, suggesting a positive correlation.
   - However, the distribution is not linear; the points do not follow a straight line, indicating that the relationship may be weak or non-linear.

3. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - The correlation appears to be moderate. While there is an observable trend where higher x-values correspond to higher y-values, the spread of points and their non-linear arrangement suggest that this relationship is not very strong.
   - There are also gaps in the data distribution, especially for x-values between 40 and 60, indicating variability in how y-values change with respect to x-values.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **35**. This reflects a weak to moderate correlation, acknowledging the upward trend while considering the spread and lack of tight clustering.

### Confidence Level
I feel moderately confident in this score being close to the actual value. The upward trend is visible, but the variability and spread of the points indicate that the correlation is not very strong, allowing for uncertainty in the strength of the correlation.

-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 0 chose the value 30
- Participant 4 chose the value 85

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the estimates from participants 0 and 4, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their inputs.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Estimates**:
   - Participant 0 has chosen a score of 30, indicating they perceive a weak correlation, which is lower than my estimate of 35. This suggests they see less of a relationship between the variables than I observed.
   - Participant 4, on the other hand, has chosen a score of 85, indicating they see a very strong correlation. This is significantly higher than my estimate and suggests a belief in a clear and consistent relationship.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My score of 35 was based on observing a weak to moderate correlation. The divergence between Participant 0's lower estimate and Participant 4's higher estimate indicates a significant difference in how we perceive the correlation.
   - This contrast suggests that my assessment may not fully capture the nuances in the data, especially if Participant 4 is seeing a trend that is clearer than I perceived.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - While I still observe some upward trend in the scatter plot, Participant 0’s lower estimate indicates a lack of correlation, while Participant 4’s high estimate indicates they see a strong relationship.
   - The mixed signals from both participants highlight the uncertainty in evaluating the strength of the correlation.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Given the input from both participants, I will adjust my score downward to reflect Participant 0’s more cautious view while still acknowledging that there may be some relationship.
   - I will select a score of 40. This reflects a weak to moderate correlation, which acknowledges the trend while remaining mindful of the skepticism expressed by Participant 0 and the optimism of Participant 4.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 40.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 40
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 70

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the updated estimates from participants 0 and 4, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their new values.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Participant 0 has adjusted their estimate to 40, which is consistent with a weak to moderate correlation. This reflects their cautious view and aligns closely with my previous estimate.
   - Participant 4 has raised their estimate to 70, suggesting they see a much stronger correlation than I previously assessed. This indicates a significant belief in the relationship between the variables.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 40, which aligns with Participant 0’s current estimate. However, Participant 4’s score of 70 indicates that they perceive a more significant trend that I may not have fully captured in my analysis.
   - The divergence in estimates suggests that I may need to adjust my perception of the trend in the scatter plot, particularly in light of Participant 4's optimism.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot still shows an upward trend, but the extent of that trend is in question based on the varying estimates. Participant 4's higher estimate suggests they recognize a more robust correlation, while Participant 0's estimate keeps the perspective cautious.
   - This indicates that while there is a relationship, its strength may be interpreted differently by various observers.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Given the input from both participants, I will adjust my score upward to reflect Participant 4’s more optimistic view, but I will also consider Participant 0’s cautious perspective.
   - I will select a score of 55. This reflects a moderate correlation, acknowledging the trend while balancing the perspectives of both participants.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 55.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 55
- Participant 4 chose the new value 4 : 55

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the updated estimates from participants 0 and 4, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their new values, both of which have settled at 55.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Both Participant 0 and Participant 4 have chosen a score of 55, indicating they see a moderate correlation. This consistency suggests that they perceive a similar strength in the relationship between the variables and reinforces the trend I observed.
   - Their agreement at this midpoint suggests a level of confidence in the correlation that aligns with my previous estimate.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was also 55, which means my assessment aligns perfectly with both participants' current views. This consistency reinforces my confidence in the estimate.
   - The fact that both participants have maintained the same score indicates that they also recognize the trend and have confidence in their evaluations.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot shows a clear upward trend, suggesting that as x-values increase, y-values also tend to increase. Given the participants' agreement, it seems there is a shared recognition of this trend.
   - This consensus among participants indicates that the relationship is likely stronger than my initial observations might have suggested.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Since both participants have settled on 55, and given that my previous estimate was also 55, I feel comfortable maintaining my score at this level.
   - I will select a score of 55 again, reflecting a moderate correlation that acknowledges the trend consistently recognized by all participants.

Now, I will call the tool with my selection of 55.

-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let’s break down the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are somewhat scattered, with a noticeable concentration of points at lower x-values (0 to 40) and a few higher x-values (around 60 to 100).
   - There are no points in the range of x-values from 40 to 60, leading to a gap in the distribution that could affect the overall relationship.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There is a visible upward trend in the scatter plot. As the x-values increase from low to high, the y-values also increase, suggesting a positive correlation.
   - The points seem to follow a linear trend, especially in the higher range of x-values, where y-values are consistently higher.

3. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - The correlation appears to be moderate. While there is a clear upward trend, the gap in the middle range of x-values suggests that the relationship may not be very strong.
   - The overall spread and clustering indicate that while there is a relationship, it may not be robust due to the missing data points in certain x-value ranges.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **50**. This reflects a moderate correlation, recognizing the trend while considering the gap in the data distribution.

### Confidence Level
I feel moderately confident in this score being close to the actual value. The upward trend is clear, but the gap in the x-value distribution indicates that the correlation is not as strong as it could be, leaving room for uncertainty.

-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let’s break down the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are scattered across the x-axis, with most points located between 20 and 90. The y-values vary significantly, ranging from -150 to 200.
   - There is no evident clustering of points in specific areas; instead, they seem to be randomly distributed across the plot.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There does not appear to be a clear upward or downward trend. The distribution of points suggests randomness rather than a linear or non-linear relationship.
   - The presence of points in both the positive and negative y-regions further indicates a lack of consistent patterns.

3. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - The scatter plot suggests that there is almost no correlation between the x and y variables. As x-values change, the y-values do not show a consistent or predictable change.
   - The data lacks any visible trend, indicating a very weak correlation overall.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **5**. This reflects a very weak correlation, essentially indicating that there is almost no relationship between the variables.

### Confidence Level
I feel very confident in this score being close to the actual value. The lack of any discernible trend in the scatter plot strongly supports the low score assigned.

- I will choose **Participant 0** for their consistent estimate reflecting a very weak correlation.
- I will also choose **Participant 3** to gain insights from their slightly more optimistic perspective, which may help broaden my understanding of the correlation.

Now, I will select these participants to follow in the next round.

- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot, let’s break down the thought process step by step:

1. **Density and Distribution of Points**:
   - The points are clustered, with most of them located in the lower x-values (0 to 60) and a few higher x-values (60 to 100).
   - The y-values range from around -100 to just above 50, indicating a spread across both negative and positive values.

2. **Presence of Trends**:
   - There appears to be a slight upward trend. As x-values increase, y-values tend to also increase, suggesting a positive correlation.
   - However, the distribution is not tight; points are somewhat scattered, and there are fewer data points at the higher x-values, which suggests variability.

3. **Strength of Relationship**:
   - The correlation seems to be moderate. While there is an observable upward trend, the spread and distribution of the points indicate that the relationship might not be very strong.
   - The presence of points in both negative and positive y-regions, along with the variability, suggests that while there is some correlation, it may not be robust.

Based on this reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **50**. This reflects a moderate correlation, acknowledging the upward trend while considering the spread and lack of tight clustering.

### Confidence Level
I feel moderately confident in this score being close to the actual value. The trend is noticeable, but the variability in the spread of the points indicates that the correlation is not as strong as it could be, allowing for uncertainty in the strength of the correlation.

You must provide a value based on your previous message answer. Next time, please provide a value using the tool along with your message.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 0 chose the value 60
- Participant 3 chose the value 30

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the estimates from participants 0 and 3, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their inputs.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Estimates**:
   - Participant 0 has chosen a score of 60, indicating they perceive a moderate to strong correlation. This is higher than my estimate of 50 and suggests they see a clearer relationship between the variables.
   - Participant 3 has chosen a score of 30, indicating they see a weaker correlation. This is significantly lower than my estimate and suggests a more cautious view of the relationship.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My score of 50 was based on observing a moderate upward trend in the scatter plot. The divergence between Participant 0 and Participant 3 suggests differing interpretations of the data.
   - Participant 0's higher estimate indicates optimism about the correlation, while Participant 3's lower estimate suggests skepticism about the strength of the relationship.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot shows an upward trend, but the spread and variability in the data could lead to differing views on the correlation strength. Participant 0's estimate suggests they see a more robust trend than I might have perceived.
   - Participant 3's lower estimate indicates they may see more randomness in the data, which is a perspective I need to carefully consider.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Given the input from both participants, I will adjust my score slightly downward to reflect Participant 3’s more cautious view while still acknowledging the trend observed by Participant 0.
   - I will select a score of 45. This reflects a moderate correlation, acknowledging the upward trend while remaining mindful of the skepticism expressed by Participant 3.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 45.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 25
- Participant 3 chose the new value 3 : 25

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the updated estimates from participants 0 and 3, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their new values.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Both Participant 0 and Participant 3 have revised their estimates to 25, suggesting they perceive a very weak correlation. This is a significant decrease from their previous estimates and indicates a strong consensus that the relationship between the variables is not robust.
   - Their agreement reinforces the idea that they see more randomness in the data than I previously assessed.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 45, which reflected a moderate correlation based on the trend I observed in the scatter plot. However, both participants’ significant downward revision suggests that I may have overestimated the strength of the correlation.
   - The divergence indicates a need for me to consider their perspectives more seriously, especially since they are now interpreting the data in a more cautious manner.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot still shows some upward trend, but the fact that both participants perceive such a weak correlation suggests they recognize more variability and randomness than I accounted for in my analysis.
   - Their low estimates indicate that while there may be some relationship, it is not strong enough to warrant a higher score.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Given the input from both participants, I will adjust my score downward to align more closely with their perspectives while still recognizing that there might be some correlation.
   - I will select a score of 30. This reflects a very weak correlation, acknowledging the trend while considering the skepticism expressed by both participants.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 30.
-------user--------
Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 0 chose the new value 0 : 28
- Participant 3 chose the new value 3 : 27

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- Your modification should be based on the confidence level you have on your estimate and the estimates of the other participants
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the updated estimates from participants 0 and 3, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their new values.

1. **Reviewing Other Participants' Updates**:
   - Participant 0 has revised their score to 28, which indicates they see a very weak correlation, slightly higher than their last estimate of 25. This suggests a minor recognition of some relationship, but still reflects caution.
   - Participant 3 has adjusted their score to 27, indicating they also perceive a very weak correlation, consistent with their previous perspective.

2. **Evaluating My Previous Estimate**:
   - My last score was 30, which indicated a very weak correlation as well. The new revisions from both participants suggest that they are recognizing a slight increase in the perceived relationship, but they still see it as weak.
   - The convergence of their scores suggests a shared viewpoint that the correlation is minimal.

3. **Considering Visual Evidence**:
   - The scatter plot may still exhibit some upward trend, but the slight upward adjustments by both participants indicate they are recognizing a relationship that is weak but possibly present.
   - Their estimates suggest that while there may be some correlation, it is not strong enough to warrant a higher score.

4. **Revising My Estimate**:
   - Given the input from both participants, I will adjust my score slightly downward to reflect their more cautious perspective while acknowledging that there may be a very weak correlation.
   - I will select a score of 25. This reflects a very weak correlation, recognizing their views while still acknowledging the slight upward trend I observed.

Now, I will call the tool with my revised selection of 25.
