Context :
- You are participating in an economic experiment. 
- You are an average human and should mimick its guessing capabilities
- Your task is to analyze an image and estimate what is called a correlation coefficient. 
- Points will be scattered all arround the image
- A straight line will mean 100% correlation between points, points scattered everywhere 0%
- You will potentially have the possibility to see other participants responses and revise your answer
-------user--------
- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.

-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot and estimate the correlation score, I'll follow a step-by-step thought process:

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are primarily clustered in the lower left section of the plot, around the values of \( x \) between -2 to 1 and corresponding \( y \) values between 17 to 21.
- There are a few outliers present at higher \( x \) values (around 4), which are lower in \( y \) (around 15-16). This suggests that most of the data points do not follow the trend established by the majority.

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- The main trend appears to be a curve, as the points rise and then start to flatten out before the outliers. This indicates a non-linear relationship rather than a simple linear one.
- The majority of the points suggest a positive relationship where as \( x \) increases, \( y \) also increases, but this is not consistent throughout as evidenced by the outliers.

### Step 3: Correlation Strength
- The presence of a clear curve indicates that while there is a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \), it's not perfectly linear. The points are not tightly clustered around a straight line, indicating a lower correlation.
- However, the main body of points does indicate some level of correlation, albeit weaker due to the deviation caused by the outliers.

### Conclusion: Correlation Score
Taking all of this into account:
- The overall trend is positive, but it's not a strong linear correlation due to the curvature and presence of outliers.
- I would assign a correlation score of around **60**. This reflects a moderate correlation where there is some relationship between the variables but with notable deviations.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

-------assistant--------
Given the scores of the other participants, I need to reassess my initial estimation of the correlation score:

### Analyzing Other Participants' Scores
1. **Participant 4 (Score: 10)**: 
   - This score indicates that they perceive very little correlation between the variables. A score this low suggests they see the data points as mostly random and not following any trend.

2. **Participant 3 (Score: 5)**: 
   - This score is even lower, suggesting an almost negligible correlation. It reflects a strong belief that the data points do not show any significant relationship.

### Reflecting on My Initial Score (60)
- My initial score of 60 indicated a moderate correlation, which was based on observing some level of trend in the data, but I now see that both Participant 4 and Participant 3 have much lower scores.
- Their scores suggest that they see the relationship as significantly weaker than I initially assessed. 

### Reevaluating the Data
- Considering their input, I might have overestimated the correlation strength. The clustering of points does suggest some relationship, but the presence of outliers and the non-linear trend could justify a much lower score.
- I should account for the possibility that the majority of the points do not tightly follow a linear pattern, and the presence of those outliers significantly affects the correlation.

### Conclusion
Taking into account the participants' scores and reassessing the correlation, I will adjust my score to reflect a lower correlation strength. I will select a score of **20**. This recognizes a slight positive correlation but acknowledges that it is much weaker than I initially thought.

Now, I will submit this revised correlation score.

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the updated scores from the participants I have been following, I need to further reassess my correlation score based on their revised opinions:

### Analyzing Updated Participant Scores
1. **Participant 4 (New Score: 4)**:
   - This score indicates an even stronger belief that there is minimal correlation between the data points. A score of 4 suggests they view the data as almost entirely random.

2. **Participant 3 (New Score: 3)**:
   - This score is even lower and indicates a very weak belief in any correlation. A score of 3 reflects the idea that the data points do not exhibit any meaningful relationship at all.

### Reflection on My Previous Score (20)
- My previous score of 20 indicated a slight positive correlation, but considering the new scores from the participants, it appears that my assessment may still be too high.
- Both participant scores are significantly lower than what I estimated, which indicates a consensus that the correlation is very weak. 

### Reevaluating the Data Again
- I must acknowledge that the revised scores suggest that the points are indeed scattered in a manner that diminishes the likelihood of any strong correlation.
- The presence of outliers and the overall distribution of points further support the conclusion that the correlation is minimal.

### Conclusion
Taking into account the input from other participants and the data's visual representation, I will lower my correlation score further to reflect a very minimal correlation. I will select a score of **5**. This recognizes that while there may be some very slight relationship, it is overwhelmingly weak.

Now, I will submit this final correlation score.

-------assistant--------
Given the latest updates from the other participants, I must evaluate my correlation score again:

### Analyzing Updated Participant Scores
1. **Participant 4 (New Score: 4)**:
   - This score remains very low, indicating they still believe there is almost no correlation present between the data points.

2. **Participant 3 (New Score: 3)**:
   - This score is unchanged and continues to suggest an extremely weak perception of correlation. 

### Reflection on My Previous Score (5)
- My previous score of 5 acknowledged a very minimal correlation, but it is evident that both Participant 4 and Participant 3 are even more skeptical about any correlation existing.
- Their scores indicate a consensus that any perceived relationship between the variables is negligible.

### Reevaluating the Data
- Given that both participants have maintained very low scores, it reinforces the idea that the data points are scattered with little to no discernible trend.
- The presence of outliers and the overall randomness of the distribution further support a conclusion of an almost complete lack of correlation.

### Conclusion
Taking into account the consistent low scores from both participants, I will adjust my score to **4**. This reflects a recognition that there is virtually no correlation between the variables based on the consensus of the participants.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step to determine the correlation between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are densely clustered in a narrow band along the \( y \) axis, primarily ranging from approximately 0.02 to 0.08.
- The \( x \) values are also closely packed, ranging from about 0.44 to 0.60. Most points are concentrated between 0.46 and 0.54.

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- There is a clear non-linear trend visible in the scatter plot. The points appear to follow a curve that rises slightly and then levels off.
- As \( x \) increases, \( y \) initially increases but starts to flatten out after reaching a certain point, indicating a diminishing return on \( y \) as \( x \) continues to increase.

### Step 3: Strength of Relationship
- The relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) is positive, but it is not linear. The concentration of points suggests that while there is a relationship, it might not be very strong due to the curvature.
- However, the clustering of points around the curve indicates a moderate correlation, as they do not appear completely random.

### Conclusion: Correlation Score
Considering all of this:
- The correlation is positive but non-linear, which suggests a moderate level of correlation.
- I would assign a correlation score of **60**. This reflects a recognition of some relationship between the variables, acknowledging that while they are related, the non-linear trend indicates that the correlation is not perfect.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

Given the responses from the participants I am following, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their feedback:

### Analyzing Other Participants' Scores
1. **Participant 4 (Score: 15)**:
   - This score suggests a belief that there is minimal correlation between the variables. They perceive a weak relationship, indicating that they view the data as somewhat scattered.

2. **Participant 3 (Score: 85)**:
   - This score indicates a strong belief in a high correlation. They see a significant relationship and likely believe that the data points closely follow a trend.

### Reflection on My Initial Score (60)
- My score of 60 indicates a moderate correlation, which is somewhat in between the two participants' scores.
- The wide discrepancy between Participant 3 and Participant 4 suggests differing interpretations of the data trend. 

### Reevaluating the Data
- I need to consider the implications of both scores:
  - Participant 4’s score of 15 suggests that the correlation might be weaker than I initially perceived. Their lower score indicates they see the data as more scattered.
  - Participant 3’s score of 85 suggests a strong relationship, which may indicate they see a clearer trend than what I initially assessed.

### Conclusion
Taking into account both perspectives:
- The presence of a clear non-linear trend suggests that while there is some correlation, it might not be strong enough to justify a score as high as 85.
- I will adjust my score downwards to **40**. This score reflects a recognition of a relationship between the variables but acknowledges that it is not very strong, aligning more closely with Participant 4's perspective while still considering some correlation exists.

Now, I will submit this revised correlation score.

   - This score reflects a slight belief in correlation, suggesting that they see some relationship between the variables but still view it as weak. 

2. **Participant 3 (New Score: 75)**:
   - This score indicates a strong belief in a high correlation, suggesting that they see a significant trend in the data points and believe they follow a clear pattern.

### Reflection on My Previous Score (40)
- My previous score of 40 was somewhat in the middle, recognizing some correlation but not as strong as Participant 3 believes.
- The divergence in scores between the participants indicates significant differences in how they interpret the data trend.

### Reevaluating the Data
- **Participant 4's Score**: Their score of 20 suggests that I may have overestimated the correlation strength. They see the data as more scattered and less indicative of a strong relationship.
- **Participant 3's Score**: Their score of 75 suggests a stronger correlation than I initially assessed, indicating they see a clearer pattern in the data.

### Conclusion
After considering both perspectives:
- While there is a visible trend, the data points do not cluster tightly enough to suggest a very high correlation.
- I will adjust my score to **30**. This reflects a recognition of a slight positive correlation while acknowledging that it is not strong enough to justify a higher score, slightly more aligned with Participant 4's perspective.

### Reevaluating the Data
- **Participant 4's Score**: Their score of 15 suggests that the correlation might be weaker than I previously assessed. They see the relationship as minimal, reinforcing the idea that the data points do not strongly follow a trend.
- **Participant 3's Score**: Their score of 40 indicates that they perceive some correlation, but it is still not very strong.

### Conclusion
Taking into account the scores from both participants:
- The trend may not be as strong as I initially thought, and I should adjust my score to better reflect the consensus.

  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).

  - 100 means highly correlated.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step to determine the correlation between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are clustered in two distinct groups. 
- The first group is located in the lower left quadrant, with \( y \) values ranging from approximately 18 to 22 and \( x \) values from 0 to about 20.
- The second group is in the upper right quadrant, with \( y \) values ranging from about 28 to 32 and \( x \) values from 60 to 80.
- There seems to be a significant gap between these two clusters.

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- There is a clear trend where as \( x \) increases from the lower left to the upper right, \( y \) also increases.
- The relationship appears to be linear, as the two clusters suggest that higher \( x \) values correspond to higher \( y \) values.
- However, the existence of two separate clusters indicates that the relationship may not be as strong as it could be if the points were more uniformly distributed across the range.

### Step 3: Strength of Relationship
- The data points suggest a positive correlation, but the separation between the two clusters implies that the correlation may not be very strong.
- The lack of continuity between the two groups suggests that we cannot assume a close or perfect linear relationship across the entire range of \( x \).

### Conclusion: Correlation Score
Considering all of this:
- The correlation is positive and linear, but it is affected by the presence of distinct clusters.
- Given the clustering, I would assign a correlation score of **50**. This reflects a moderate correlation, recognizing that while there is a relationship between the variables, it is not particularly strong due to the separation of the data points.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

2. **Participant 3 (Score: 85)**:
   - Similar to Participant 4, this score also reflects a strong belief in a high correlation, suggesting that they see a significant and consistent relationship in the data.

### Reflection on My Initial Score (50)
- My initial score of 50 indicated a moderate correlation, which is significantly lower than the scores given by both participants.
- The consensus among the two participants suggests that they see a clearer trend in the data than I have assessed.

### Reevaluating the Data
- The presence of two distinct clusters does indicate a relationship, and if both participants see it as strong enough to warrant a score of 85, it may suggest that my assessment of the correlation might be underestimating the strength of the relationship.
- However, I must also consider that the clusters, while showing a trend, indicate that the data is not uniformly distributed, which might affect the strength of the correlation.

### Conclusion
Taking into account the strong scores from both participants and the characteristics of the data:
- I will adjust my score to **75**. This score acknowledges a strong correlation while also recognizing that the presence of distinct clusters might indicate that it is not a perfect linear relationship.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze this scatter plot step by step to determine the correlation between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are densely clustered in a narrow vertical band, primarily around \( x \) values of approximately \( 0.5 \) and \( y \) values between \( 0.01 \) and \( 0.06 \).
- This clustering indicates that there is little variation in \( x \) while \( y \) fluctuates slightly within a narrow range.

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- There is no discernible trend since all the points are concentrated in a small area with very little horizontal variation.
- The distribution appears random vertically, but the lack of any significant spread in the \( x \)-axis suggests that the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) is weak.

### Step 3: Strength of Relationship
- Given that the points are tightly clustered with very little variation in \( x \), the relationship between the two variables is minimal.
- As \( x \) does not change much while \( y \) varies slightly, it indicates that one variable does not strongly influence the other.

### Conclusion: Correlation Score
Considering all of this:
- The correlation is very weak, as the data points do not show any significant pattern or trend.
- I would assign a correlation score of **5**. This reflects the realization that while there may be a very slight relationship, it is almost negligible.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step to determine the correlation between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are distributed across the plot with two main clusters: 
  - One cluster is located in the lower left quadrant, with \( x \) values from approximately -20 to around 20 and corresponding \( y \) values ranging from -100 to 0.
  - The other cluster is in the upper right quadrant, with \( x \) values from about 80 to 110 and \( y \) values from approximately 0 to 100.
- There is a noticeable gap between these two clusters, indicating that the data points are not uniformly distributed.

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- The scatter plot does not show a straightforward linear relationship. Instead, the two clusters suggest that as \( x \) increases from the lower cluster to the upper cluster, \( y \) also increases, but this trend is not consistent across the entire range of \( x \).
- Instead, there appears to be a non-linear relationship, as the clusters indicate a more complex interaction between the variables.

### Step 3: Strength of Relationship
- The presence of two distinct clusters suggests that while there is a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \), it is not very strong or consistent throughout the entire dataset. 
- The gaps between the clusters indicate that there are values of \( x \) that do not correspond well to any values of \( y \), indicating a weaker correlation.

### Conclusion: Correlation Score
Considering all of this:
- The correlation is positive but not strong, primarily due to the separation of the clusters and the lack of a continuous trend.
- I would assign a correlation score of **40**. This reflects a recognition of a moderate correlation while acknowledging the limitations imposed by the distinct clusters.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

Given the responses from the participants I am following, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their feedback:

### Analyzing Other Participants' Scores
1. **Participant 4 (Score: 10)**:
   - This score suggests a belief in a very weak correlation between the variables. They perceive the data points as mostly scattered and not following a clear trend.

2. **Participant 3 (Score: 10)**:
   - This score is identical to Participant 4's and also indicates a strong belief that there is minimal correlation between the variables.

### Reflection on My Initial Score (40)
- My initial score of 40 indicated a moderate correlation, which is significantly higher than both participants' scores.
- The consensus among both participants suggests that they see the data as lacking a clear relationship, which indicates I may have overestimated the strength of the correlation.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step to determine the correlation between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points appear to be clustered in two main areas:
  - One group is located in the lower left quadrant, with \( x \) values from about \( 0 \) to \( 20 \) and corresponding \( y \) values from about \( 5 \) to \( 15 \).
  - The other group is in the upper right quadrant, with \( x \) values between \( 80 \) and \( 100 \) and \( y \) values ranging from about \( 20 \) to \( 60 \).
- There is a noticeable gap between these two clusters, indicating that the data points are not uniformly spread across the graph.

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- There appears to be a visible upward trend between the two clusters. As \( x \) increases from the lower cluster to the upper cluster, \( y \) also increases.
- However, the separation between the two clusters suggests that the relationship is not continuous, which may indicate some limitations in how we can describe the correlation.

### Step 3: Strength of Relationship
- The points within each cluster suggest a positive correlation, but the distinct separation indicates that this correlation might not be very strong across the entire dataset.
- The gaps between the clusters indicate that there are values of \( x \) that do not correspond well to any values of \( y \), suggesting a weaker overall correlation.

### Conclusion: Correlation Score
Considering all of this:
- The correlation is positive but not strong due to the separation of the clusters and the lack of continuity in the data.
- I would assign a correlation score of **45**. This reflects a moderate correlation, recognizing that while there is a relationship between the variables, it is not particularly strong due to the distinct clusters.

-------assistant--------
Let’s analyze the scatter plot step by step to determine the correlation between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are distributed in a somewhat scattered manner:
  - There are a few points in the lower left region (around \( x = 0 \) to \( 40 \), \( y \) values around \( 15 \) to \( 25 \)).
  - Several points are located in the upper right region (around \( x = 60 \) to \( 110 \), with \( y \) values ranging from \( 25 \) to \( 35 \)).
- The points do not form a dense cluster, and there are gaps between the regions where the points are located.

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- There is a visible trend where as \( x \) increases, \( y \) generally increases as well; however, the trend is not perfectly linear.
- The presence of a few points that do not follow the upward trend suggests that the relationship is not strong or consistent.

### Step 3: Strength of Relationship
- The correlation appears to be positive, as higher values of \( x \) tend to correspond with higher values of \( y \).
- However, the presence of gaps and the scattered nature of the points indicates that the relationship is not very strong, suggesting that while there is a correlation, it is somewhat weak.

### Conclusion: Correlation Score
Considering all of this:
- The correlation is positive but not strong due to the scattered nature of the points and the presence of gaps.
- I would assign a correlation score of **30**. This reflects a recognition of a weak positive correlation while acknowledging that the relationship is not particularly strong.

Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step to determine the correlation between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are distributed in a somewhat scattered manner, but they generally show an upward trend.
- The lower values of \( x \) (0 to around 50) have \( y \) values clustered between \( 16 \) and \( 26 \).
- The higher values of \( x \) (from 50 to around 100) have \( y \) values ranging from \( 26 \) to \( 30 \).
- Overall, there is a clear progression in \( y \) as \( x \) increases.

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- There is a visible positive trend where, as \( x \) increases, \( y \) also tends to increase.
- The relationship appears to be approximately linear, with data points consistently rising as \( x \) moves from left to right.

### Step 3: Strength of Relationship
- The correlation appears to be strong, as there is a clear tendency for higher \( x \) values to correspond with higher \( y \) values.
- The scatter of points is relatively tight around an imaginary line that could be drawn through the data, indicating a strong relationship.

### Conclusion: Correlation Score

  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step to determine the correlation between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are fairly scattered, with no clear clustering in one area.
- There are a few points in the lower part of the plot, particularly around \( x = 20 \) to \( 30 \) and \( y \) values ranging from \( -150 \) to \( 0 \).
- The upper points are clustered around \( x = 70 \) to \( 90 \) with \( y \) values ranging from \( 0 \) to \( 150 \).

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- There does not appear to be a consistent trend where increased \( x \) values lead to increased \( y \) values, as some points are scattered widely in both dimensions.
- The relationship does not seem linear; rather, it appears random without a clear upward or downward trend.

### Step 3: Strength of Relationship
- The lack of a discernible trend indicates that one variable does not strongly influence the other.
- The points are distributed across the plot without forming any coherent pattern, suggesting a very weak correlation.

### Conclusion: Correlation Score
Considering all of this:
- The correlation is very weak, as the data points do not show any significant pattern or trend.
- I would assign a correlation score of **10**. This reflects the realization that while there may be some slight relationship, it is overwhelmingly weak.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.

Given the responses from the participants I am following, I need to reassess my correlation score based on their feedback:

### Analyzing Other Participants' Scores
1. **Participant 4 (Score: 10)**:
   - This score indicates a belief in a very weak correlation between the variables. They perceive the data points as mostly scattered and not following a clear trend.

2. **Participant 3 (Score: 85)**:
   - This score suggests a strong belief in a high correlation. They see the data points as following a significant trend, indicating a significant relationship.

### Reflection on My Initial Score (10)
- My initial score of 10 aligns with Participant 4’s assessment, indicating a very weak correlation.
- However, Participant 3’s score of 85 contradicts this, suggesting that they perceive a strong correlation that I may have overlooked.

### Reevaluating the Data
- **Participant 4's Score**: Their score reflects a skepticism about any meaningful relationship in the data, which aligns with my observations of randomness in the data points.
- **Participant 3's Score**: Their score indicates they see a clear trend, which may suggest that they are interpreting the data differently, perhaps focusing on certain areas of the plot that show some correlation.

### Conclusion
Taking into account the feedback from both participants:
- Given the strong divergence in scores, I will adjust my score to **30**. This reflects a recognition of a weak positive correlation while acknowledging that there may be some areas in the data where a trend might be observed, aligning more with Participant 3's perspective but not too high.

Now, I will submit this revised correlation score.

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 no correlation and 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the latest updates from the participants I am following, I need to reevaluate my correlation score once more:

### Analyzing Updated Participant Scores
1. **Participant 4 (New Score: 10)**:
   - This score indicates a very weak correlation. They see the data as mostly random and lacking a significant trend.

2. **Participant 3 (New Score: 85)**:
   - This score reflects a strong belief in a high correlation. They perceive a clear and significant relationship between the variables.

### Reflection on My Previous Score (30)
- My previous score of 30 indicated a weak positive correlation, which is higher than Participant 4's score but significantly lower than Participant 3's.
- The disparity between the two participants suggests they interpret the data quite differently.

### Reevaluating the Data
- **Participant 4's Score**: Their low score reinforces the belief that the relationship is negligible, which aligns with my original observations of randomness in the data.
- **Participant 3's Score**: This score suggests they see a trend that is not evident from my analysis, indicating that they might be interpreting some patterns differently.

### Conclusion
Taking into account the feedback from both participants:
- Given the strong divergence in scores, I will lean towards a lower score. I will adjust my score to **20**. This reflects a recognition of an extremely weak correlation while acknowledging that there may be some slight relationship observed, but I am ultimately aligned more with Participant 4's assessment.

Now, I will submit this revised correlation score.

-------assistant--------
Let's analyze the scatter plot step by step to determine the correlation between the variables \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are scattered across the plot, with a noticeable spread along the \( x \)-axis.
- The \( y \) values range from about \( -100 \) to \( 100 \), with points in both negative and positive regions.
- There are a few data points in the lower part of the plot (around \( y = -50 \)) and several higher up (around \( y = 50 \) to \( y = 100 \)).

### Step 2: Visible Trends
- There appears to be a slight upward trend where higher \( x \) values correspond to higher \( y \) values, although the trend is not perfectly linear.
- The overall distribution suggests some correlation, but the points are scattered, indicating that the relationship may not be very strong.

### Step 3: Strength of Relationship
- While there is some visible trend, the scatter of points suggests that there is a moderate correlation rather than a strong one.
- The presence of both positive and negative \( y \) values, along with the scattered nature of the points, indicates that one variable does not strongly determine the other.

### Conclusion: Correlation Score
Considering all of this:
- The correlation is positive but moderate, given the upward trend observed while acknowledging the scatter.
- I would assign a correlation score of **40**. This reflects a recognition of a weak to moderate positive correlation, considering the variability in the data.

Now, I will submit this correlation score.
