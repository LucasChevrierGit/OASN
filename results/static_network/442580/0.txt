Context :
- You are participating in an economic experiment. 
- You are an average human and should mimick its guessing capabilities
- Your task is to analyze an image and estimate what is called a correlation coefficient. 
- Points will be scattered all arround the image
- A straight line will mean 100% correlation between points, points scattered everywhere 0%
- You will potentially have the possibility to see other participants responses and revise your answer
-------user--------
- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated (positive correlation).

-------assistant--------
To analyze the scatter plot step by step, let's consider the following aspects:

### 1. Density and Distribution of Points
- The points are relatively evenly distributed across the entire plotting area.
- There is no significant clustering around specific areas, indicating a broad spread of data points.

### 2. Presence of Trends
- Upon visual inspection, there is no clear linear trend. The points do not seem to align in any straight line or curve consistently.
- The points appear scattered, suggesting a random distribution rather than a systematic relationship between the variables.

### 3. Correlation Strength
- Given that there is no visible pattern or trend, it indicates a weak correlation between the X and Y variables.
- The scatter plot suggests that changes in one variable do not predict changes in the other, aligning with a correlation score closer to 0.

### Correlation Score
Based on the above reasoning, I would assign a correlation score of **10**. This score reflects a very weak correlation, indicating that there is minimal relationship between the variables. 

Now, I'll submit this correlation score.
-------user--------
Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 2 chose the value 60
- Participant 5 chose the value 65

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 highly anti-corrolated, 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.
-------assistant--------
Given the responses from Participants 2 and 5, let's analyze their choices and reassess my initial estimation:

### Analysis of Other Participants' Responses
- **Participant 2 (60)** and **Participant 5 (65)** both chose values that indicate a moderate correlation. Their scores suggest they observed some level of relationship between the variables, perhaps noting trends that I might have overlooked in my initial assessment.
- Their choices are significantly higher than my original score of 10, suggesting that they see a clearer pattern or relationship within the data points.

### Re-evaluating the Scatter Plot
- I will need to consider that there could be some non-linear trends or slight clustering that I did not initially recognize.
- While my original analysis indicated a random scatter, there might be some subtle correlation that others have identified, leading them to score much higher.

### Conclusion
- I will adjust my score to reflect a more moderate correlation based on the majority's perception. A score of **40** could indicate that while the correlation is still not strong, it acknowledges that there is some relationship between the variables, albeit weak.

I'll submit this adjusted correlation score of **40**.

Thank you for your answer, here are the first answer of the participants you chose to follow :
 - Participant 2 chose the value 65
- Participant 5 chose the value 25

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 highly anti-corrolated, 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.

Given the responses from Participants 2 and 5, let's analyze their choices and reassess my correlation estimation:

### Analysis of Other Participants' Responses
- **Participant 2 (65)** has chosen a value indicating they perceive a moderate to strong positive correlation in the data. This suggests they have identified trends or relationships that I may not have fully recognized in my initial analysis.
- **Participant 5 (25)** has chosen a value indicating a weak correlation, which is more in line with my original assessment but still higher than my estimate of 20.

### Reflection on the Responses
- The divergence in scores indicates differing perceptions of the correlation strength. Participant 2's higher score suggests confidence in a positive correlation, while Participant 5's lower score reflects skepticism about that correlation.
- This suggests that while there may be some identifiable trend, it is viewed very differently by the participants.

### Re-evaluating My Score
- Given that Participant 2 perceives a strong correlation and Participant 5 sees a weaker correlation, I should find a balanced score that considers both perspectives.
- I will select a value that acknowledges the trend observed while being cautious about the variability that still exists in the data.

### Conclusion
- I will select a score of **35**. This score reflects a weak to moderate correlation, recognizing the trend that Participant 2 sees while still considering the concerns expressed by Participant 5.

I'll submit this correlation score of **35**.

Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 30
- Participant 5 chose the new value 5 : 15

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 highly anti-corrolated, 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.

With the updated choices from Participants 2 and 5, let's analyze their decisions and reassess my correlation score:

### Analysis of Participants' Revised Choices
- **Participant 2 (30)** has decreased their score, indicating they perceive a weaker correlation than before, though still recognizing some minimal relationship.
- **Participant 5 (15)** has also lowered their score, suggesting they see an even weaker correlation, closer to my initial assessment.

### Reflection on the Responses
- Both participants' choices indicate a shared skepticism regarding the strength of the correlation. Their scores suggest they see the data as less correlated than previously thought.
- Participant 2's decrease suggests they may have identified more scatter or randomness in the data, while Participant 5's lower score emphasizes their belief that the correlation is weak.

### Re-evaluating My Score
- Given that both participants now perceive a much weaker correlation, I should adjust my score downward to align with their views.
- I will select a score that reflects this consensus while acknowledging that there might still be some minimal correlation.

### Conclusion
- I will select a score of **20**. This score reflects a weak correlation, recognizing the concerns raised by both participants about the relationship.

I'll submit this correlation score of **20**.

Upon reflection, just like you, the participants you followed this round updated their choice based on their first guess and the revised answer of the participants they follow :
- Participant 2 chose the new value 2 : 12
- Participant 5 chose the new value 5 : 8

- Think and explain your thought process based on the available information to make a decision.
- You should give a value between 0 and 100. (0 highly anti-corrolated, 100 highly corrolated)
- Then, you must call the tool with your selection.

With the updated choices from Participants 2 and 5, let's analyze their decisions and reassess my correlation score:

### Analysis of Participants' Revised Choices
- **Participant 2 (12)** has lowered their score further, indicating they see a very weak correlation. This suggests they perceive even more scatter or randomness in the data than previously assessed.
- **Participant 5 (8)** has also decreased their score, suggesting they see an extremely weak correlation, aligning closely with the idea that the data does not show a meaningful relationship.

### Reflection on the Responses
- The scores from both participants indicate a strong consensus that the correlation is minimal to non-existent. Their choices suggest that they view the data as highly scattered with little to no identifiable trend.
- This indicates that my previous score of 20 might have been too optimistic, as both participants are now firmly in the lower range.

### Re-evaluating My Score
- Given that both participants perceive an even weaker correlation, I should adjust my score downward in line with their assessments.
- I will select a score that reflects this consensus while recognizing that there may be some very minimal correlation present.

### Conclusion
- I will select a score of **10**. This score reflects a very weak correlation, acknowledging the strong doubts expressed by both participants about the relationship.

I'll submit this correlation score of **10**.
