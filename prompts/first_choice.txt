- Here is the picture.
- Carefully analyze the scatter plot and identify the pattern of the data points.
- Explain your thought process step by step, considering:
  - The density and distribution of the points.
  - The presence of any visible trends (linear, non-linear, random, etc.).
  - How strongly one variable changes in relation to the other.
- Based on this reasoning, assign a correlation score between 0 and 100.
  - 0 means no correlation.
  - 100 means highly correlated.
- Considering the correlation value you gave and the image available, describe how confident you are on this result being close to the actual value
